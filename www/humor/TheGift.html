<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Gift</H1>

<DIV ALIGN="justify">

         A young man wished to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's
birthday, and as they had not been dating very long, after careful
consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note....
Romantic, but not too personal.  Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger
sister, he went to Searsand bought a pair of white gloves.  The
younger sister purchased a pair of panties for herself.
<P>
         During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister
got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.
<P>
     Without checking the contents he sealed the package and mailed it
to his sweetheart along with this note:
<P>


My Dearest,
<P>

    I choose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of
wearing any when we go out in the evening.  If it had not been foryour sister,
I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears short ones that
are easy to remove.
<P>
       These are a delicate shade but the lady I bought them from showed me
the pair she had been wearing for the last three weeks and they were hardly
soiled.  I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.
<P>
       I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time, as
no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance
to see you again.
<P>
       When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them
away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.
<P>
       Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.  I
hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.
</DIV>
<P>

                                                  All My Love
<P>


P.S.  The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.
