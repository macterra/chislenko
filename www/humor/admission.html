Ihave been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making themmore efficient in the area of heat retention.  I translate ethnic slursfor Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage timeefficiently.  Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.<P>   I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilotbicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cookThirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes.  I am an expert in stucco, aveteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<P>   Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedlydefended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferociousarmy ants.  I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am thesubject of numerous documentaries.  When I'm bored, I build largesuspension bridges in my yard.  I enjoy urban hang gliding.  OnWednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.<P>   I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear.I don't perspire.  I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I havebeen caller number nine and have won the weekend passes.  Last summer, Itoured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat.400.  My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in internationalbotany circles.  Children trust me.<P>   I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy.I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day andstill had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening.  I knowthe exact location of every food item in the supermarket.  I haveperformed several covert operations for the CIA.  I sleep once a week;when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair.  While on vacation in Canada, Isuccessfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a smallbakery.  The laws of physics do not apply to me.<P>   I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.  Onweekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami.  Yearsago, I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down.  I havemade extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toasteroven.  I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan,cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I havespoken with Elvis.<P>But I have not yet gone to college.</DIV><HR>Back to: <A TARGET ="_top" HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/humor/index.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/graphics/smile_anim1.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE VSPACE=3 ALT="humor page" HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>Intelligent Humor page</A><A TARGET ="_top" REL=HOME HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/home.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/graphics/cabin.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=10 VSPACE=2 ALT="Home" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=25> Home</A><A TARGET ="_top" HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/thinkers.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/graphics/thinkers_button_anim.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=10 VSPACE=2 ALT="Thinkers" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40>Great Thinkers page</A><P><CENTER>Sponsored by<BR><A HREF="http://tracker.clicktrade.com/tracker/tracker.dll?to='http://www.tlk-lists.com/join/'&ad=83046.0&lp=14528"><IMG SRC="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/graphics/banner_tlk_lists.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=70 ALT="The Learning Kingdom's free daily email lists"></a></CENTER><P><CENTER><!--Begin: trafficX Exchange Code: Do not modify--><a href="http://trafficx.com/servlet/txLink?id=I000209&page=24" target="_top"><img src="http://trafficx.com/servlet/txBanner?id=I000209&dim=2&type=1&page=24"alt="trafficX Exchange" border=1 width=400 height=40></a><!--End: trafficX Exchange Code--></CENTER><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://ad.linkexchange.com/24/X317290/gotoad.map" target="_top"><IMG WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=1 ismap ALT="LinkExchange"SRC="http://ad.linkexchange.com/24/X317290/logoshowad?free"></A><BR><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF="http://www.linkexchange.com/" target="_top">LinkExchange member</A></FONT></CENTER><!-- 123Banners Code Begin - Thinkers page--><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.123banners.com/cgi-localbin/banners/members/com/X02076/gotoad.pl"><IMG SRC="http://www.123banners.com/cgi-localbin/banners/getad?X02076"WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=40 ISMAP></A><BR><A HREF="http://www.123banners.com/"><FONT SIZE=-2>Member of 123Banners</FONT></A></CENTER><!-- 123Banners Code End --><img src="http://tracker.clicktrade.com/Tracker/Depth.dll?ad=14528" ALT="" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1></BODY></HTML>
