<UL>
<LI>As I let go of my shoulds and feelings of guilt, I
can get in touch with my Inner Sociopath.</LI>

<LI>I have the power to channel my imagination into
ever-soaring levels of suspicion and paranoia.</LI>

<LI>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except
the ones that are someone else's fault.</LI>

<LI>I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise
myself. Unless, of course, I want to stay employed.</LI>

<LI>In some cultures what I do would be considered
normal.</LI>

<LI>Having control over myself is nearly as good as
having control over others.</LI>

<LI>My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good
judgment.</LI>

<LI>I can change any thought that hurts into a reality
that hurts even more.</LI>

<LI>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I
would have no personality at all.</LI>

<LI>Joan of Arc heard voices too.</LI>

<LI>I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all
those censorious, self-righteous people around me.</LI>

<LI>I need not suffer in silence while I can still
moan, whimper and complain.</LI>

<LI>As I learn the innermost secrets of the people
around me, they reward me in many ways to keep me quiet.</LI>

<LI>When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than
a lawsuit. But not nearly as gratifying.</LI>

<LI>The first step is to say nice things about myself.
The second, to do nice things for myself. The third, to find
someone to buy me nice things.</LI>

<LI>All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly,
stupid, and disgusting parts.</LI>

<LI>I am at one with my duality.</LI>

<LI>I will strive to live each day as if it were my
40th birthday.</LI>

<LI>Only a lack of imagination saves me from
immobilizing myself with imaginary fears.</LI>

<LI>I honor and express all facets of my being,
regardless of state and local laws.</LI>

<LI>Today I will gladly share my experience and advice,
for there are no sweeter words than &quot;I told you
so.&quot;</LI>

<LI>False hope is nicer than no hope at all.</LI>

<LI>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution
to the problem.</LI>

<LI>Just for today, I will not sit in my living room
all day watching TV.  Instead I will move my TV into the
bedroom.</LI>

<LI>Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I
can spend it worrying about the future?</LI>

<LI>The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign
that the conspiracy is working.</LI>

<LI>I am learning that criticism is not nearly as
effective as sabotage.</LI>

<LI>Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to
the next step - blaming my parents.</LI>

<LI>To have a successful relationship I must learn to
make it look like I'm giving as much as I'm getting.</LI>

<LI>To understand all is to fear all.</LI>
