<H1>Theory of Humor</H1>
<DIV ALIGN="justify">
First, two explanations I heard so far (in my own words, but I am trying
to be correct):

<P>The general line here is: joke = humor = laughter</P>

<DL>
<DT>Sigmund Freud:</DT>

<DD>One can't express aggression and sexual drive directly, as it is prohibited
in the society, so these desires get sublimated in telling &quot;jokes&quot;.
If you look at jokes, they are either about somebody getting hurt, or they
have sexual connotations.</DD>
<P>
<DT>Marvin Minsky:</DT>

<DD>There are not only general social prohibitions. There are also things
your mother told you not to do - like stick your finger into your eye.
So when you tell a story about something stupid, you attack the rules of
common sense, in a safe and socially acceptable manner.</DD>
</DL>

So Minsky adds jokes about stupidity. Freud's advocate could explain
jokes about stupidity as manifestations of aggression against other people
- stupid things *you* do are never funny. I wouldn't call it a strong argument
though. Minsky also shifts attention from urges to social prohibitions
a bit; this raises the level of intelligence in the reasons, and includes
jokes about stupidity in an integrated manner.

<P>There are some things though that both of these explanations do not
account for:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The biological origin of humor. The above explanations make humor
appear as a function that is either programmed culturally, or if biological,
then very recent - after the development of language, at least. These explanation
suggest no ties with previous evolutionary development and pre-speech mental
mechanisms.</LI>

<LI>Social role of humor Seeing how much joy (emotional reward) people
derive from humor, one could assume that there should be more serious social
reason why such behavior would be rewarded, then letting out steam of urges.</LI>

<LI>In many cases, people are ready to openly express more aggression,
sexuality, and disagreement with authorities that they are suggesting in
the jokes, so their jokes can hardly be viewed as a suppressed revolt.
Peaceful people and innocent children find lots of things funny; children
find things funny (such as peek-a-boo) that adults don't and wouldn't teach
them; there is hardly any evidence that people with strongly suppressed
anger or sexuality have more interest in jokes than people who do not have
these interests, or feel free to express them.</LI>

<LI>Most of references to sex, violence and stupidity are not funny.
Let me try a few non-jokes:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Hitler died.</LI>

<LI>Bill is an idiot.</LI>

<LI>Alice and Bob had sex and then Alice killed Bob by mistake.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Are you laughing yet? Why not? These sentences contained all suggested
ingredients of jokes. Maybe, these levels of references are socially acceptable?
I think so, but we couldn't make these sentences funny by making &quot;forbidden&quot;
references more explicit. Maybe they were too brief? Then imagine how much
you'd laugh at a research paper on prostate cancer and corresponding mortality
rates. Or maybe, some crucial ingredient of humor just wasn't there? Then
what is that missing ingredient?</P>

<LI>There are lots of things we consider funny that do not have anything
to do with sex, violence or stupidity. The above theories offer no explanations.</LI>

<P>Why do kids consider peek-a-boo funny? Why is it funny when I pull a
pig out of my pocket during a conversation?</P>
</OL>

<P>How about the following jokes: (bear with me, it's for scientific purpose)
<HR></P>

<DL>
<LI>&quot;Why does the giraffe have such a long neck?&quot; - &quot;because
its head is so far away from its body that a long neck is simply necessary
to reach it&quot;</LI>

<LI>&quot;What is in common between a plum and an elephant?&quot; - &quot;they
are both purple, except for the elephant.&quot;</LI>

<LI>&quot;why didn't the skeleton cross the road?&quot; - &quot;Because
it didn't have the guts&quot;.</LI>

<LI>&quot;Two wrongs don't make a right, but three left turns do.&quot;</LI>
</DL>

And a few quotations:

<UL>
<LI>Oscar Wilde on his deathbed:</LI>

<UL>
<P>&quot;It's either the wallpaper or me. One of us has to go.&quot;</P>
</UL>

<LI>Edgar W. Howe:</LI>

<UL>
<P>Instead of loving your enemies, treat your friends a little better.</P>
</UL>


<LI>Ralph Waldo Emerson:</LI>
<UL>
I hate quotations.
</UL>
<P>

<LI>Others:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Computers are not intelligent. They just think they are.</LI>

<LI>If today is the first day of the rest of your life, what was yesterday?</LI>

<LI>A smile is a powerful weapon - you can even break ice with it.</LI>

<LI>Of all the things you wear, your expression is the most important.</LI>

<LI>Living on Earth includes an annual free trip around the Sun.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<HR>

<P>I hope you found at least some of these funny. Now, how many references
to sex, violence and stupidity did you see there?</P>

<P>Enough of criticism. Now I want to suggest an explanation of humor that
explains all of the above cases and has (or so it seems to me) apparent
biological roots and social utility.</P>

<P>The keyword here is &quot;surprise&quot;. Or, &quot;twist&quot;. Something
unexpected. Something that breaks the rules - not the social rules! - but
the rules of logic, of common sense, breaks your expectations. Like a pig
pulled out of a pocket. Or the peek-a-boo where a child finds the transition
[now you see me - now you don't] amusing, but adults, for whom it is not
new, don't. Or a &quot;punch line&quot; that adds a twist that all the
joke was built for.</P>

<P>It is programmed into us biologically, to look for all kinds of exceptions
in the outside world: changes in the level of signals, something suddenly
appearing, blinking, bursting, jumping, etc. This attention to surprises
is a result of millions of years of evolution, and can be traced from bacteria
to humans. It is natural to expect that increasingly intelligent organisms
would pay attention to increasingly complex surprises - including those
that challenge their internal models of the world by suggesting unexpected
connections between different ideas and interpretations. I heard a story
about a dog that had its favorite joke, but my model example here would
be closer to modern humans - e.g., a group of young Neanderthals. The first
and most important common project of humans was joint construction of the
mental models of the world. The cooperation went through the language,
by sharing facts for building models, passing models that seemed right
- AND sharing unexpected twists that either challenge the models, or help
define limits of their applicability, or teach when [not] to use them,
or just train your brain on amusing puzzles.</P>

<P>Neanderthals were too stupid (just as modern humans) to consciously
seek and share semantic surprises &quot;for betterment of the common knowledge
base&quot;. Built-in neural loop producing pleasure upon detection of semantic
twists helped a lot.</P>

<P>So, &quot;funny&quot; is an internal reaction to humor; it produces
pleasure. Smile and laughter are social expressions of pleasure - but not
just from humor. We smile or laugh when we see little kids play, or win
lottery, or think of something nice, or are just happy. Humor is just one
of the inputs for this reaction. When we tell people things, we try to
make sure that all their elements are interesting, so we include twists,
references to sex, things they may like to hear or see or things their
enemies wouldn't like to see. Analogously, when we have a party, we provide
space, drinks, light, heat, music, food, chairs, etc. This doesn't mean
those are the same thing - they are different, have different reasons,
and under other conditions may not be present together.</P>

<P>In the course of history, people learned to abuse the natural pleasures
they used to receive from simple natural urges and sensations. Pleasures
we derived from sweets, fats, watching rapidly moving objects and noticing
simple contradictions and little logical surprises that used to be important
for finding better food, avoiding predators, and learning new things, have
long been artificially satisfied with donuts, videogames, and jokes. If
we want to understand their nature though, we should not play with current
cultural artifacts, but look into the original reasons why these things
were developed. And their roots were all developed for one purpose - to
help the animals navigate the environment.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, humans are still wired as if they lived in the jungle.
They could understand the environment a lot better if they studied more
science and read some good philosophy - but they are still trying to get
pleasure exercising their reactions to [simulated/perverted] fast-moving
game objects, or sharing silly little twists of logic. Many people realize
quite well that these things are a waste of time, but they still can't
help it: the atavistic urges are still running us. Sometimes people try
to combine &quot;learning and fun&quot;, but this requires a lot of tricks,
as most natural implementations of &quot;fun&quot; have lost their
intended utility quite awhile ago.</P>

<P>This also explains why there are so many more freelance comedians than
philosophers. And why inventors of good videogames are much richer than
authors of great theories. It's because the comparisons of their values
are performed by neural networks taken from animals.</P>
</DIV>
<P>I personally find some bitter irony in this situation.<BR>
