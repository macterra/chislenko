Text:      "Sasha and Masha are friends".Finally, you found some radiant STUFF! at the end of the link tunnel!Or... have you?Now, let's examine the above little text:- "and" is a *link* between "Sasha" and "Masha"- "are" is a *link* between "Sasha and Masha" and "Friends"- "Friends" is a relational link and surely not STUFF! by itself- "Sasha" and "Masha" are still just words that consist of linked lettersand are, in turn, no more than links to the real Sasha and Masha who liveoff-line (or, in this case, to imaginary ones who do not "exist" at all). So then - all real STUFF is off-line, right?- Not so soon.  Aren't people "just" sets of linked atoms?Aren't atoms just a bunch of linked quarks?Now we reduced all "substance" to substrate quark powder, whichsounds quite absurd.  Even if I agree to equate "substance" to"substrate", the *only* observable - and interesting - feature ofthis "substance" seems its ability to link into complex entities.The behavior of these entities is determined by the nature of the linksand their joint architecture.  If you change the links considerably, you not only add new ways(language or HTTP) to refer to the old entities -you change the behavior of the system as a whole.  So the links of the Web are its substance in about the same way asconceptual references provided by the wordings of the linked texts, oroperational instructions contained in the machine-executable files.</STRONG></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></center><H1>Read more on </H1><H3>grand-scale futurology, evolution, philosophy and high tech issues</H3><H4><A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/home.htm"> Alexander (Sasha) Chislenko</A></H4><p><IMG SRC="rodelijn.gif"></center><pre></pre><CENTER><a href="pages.htm"><img SRC="gordijnb.gif" alt="Pages"  HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=75 BORDER=0></a><a href="index.html"><img SRC="gordijnh.gif" alt="Index"  HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=75 BORDER=0></a></center><img src="http://tracker.clicktrade.com/Tracker/Depth.dll?ad=14528" ALT="" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1></BODY></HTML>
