<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Foresight Market and research funding.</H1>

<P>In the No. 10 issue of the &quot;Foresight Update&quot; Robin Hanson
presented an interesting <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/gamble.html">proposal</A>
to create a betting market for dealing with scientific and technological
controversies, which would attract people to the discussions and offer them incentives
to be honest and responsible in expressing their opinions. I
think it is a good idea and would like to contribute some
thoughts and suggestions. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">1. AN ANECDOTE. </H3>

<P>A man is accused of paying the mafia for killing his uncle. He
defends himself: &quot;no, I just said: I bet $10,000 that my
dear old uncle will live for another 10 years... - and they
accepted the bet.&quot; </P>

<P>This
anecdote, however sad it may sound, shows that there is a very
fine line, if any, between a bet and an order for action. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> 2. PROJECT FUNDING </H3>

<P>Suppose, a research group A sees that the market bets 20 to 1 against the
feasibility of a project X (or the validity of a statement Y),
and the trading volume is high enough, and the group is 90% sure
that it can do (or check) it for this money. The group then can
start betting for the project, thus buying rights to receive
market funds after the work is completed. It is likely that the
market will not react with much additional money, and with the
group itself becoming a major player, the stakes will soon
reverse to 10 to 1 FOR the project - the group's honest and
sincere estimate of its own chances to do the work properly and
in time. Another group, B, which thinks its chances to do the
work are 60%, and needs two times as high trading volume to cover
its costs, will drop its 'bid' and sell its 'bet stocks' to group
A. (In current conditions, it well might win the bid, e.g., using
its strong contacts in Washington or good PR skills.) If,
however, the group B wants to work on the project itself and
thinks that the group A is very unlikely to fulfill it and is
just trying to steal the job - it can bet AGAINST the feasibility
of the project while working on it itself, watch the group A
fail, cash the bets, and show its own work at any time after the
deadline. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">3. BIG PROJECTS </H3>

<P>We can expect that market orders will be picked by groups with the
highest chances and the lowest costs of doing the projects - by
their own best and most sincere estimates. (Ideally.) The trading
volumes would oscillate around expected minimal costs of the
projects. </P>

<P>But
there will, of course, be bets about some extremely costly,
complex and uncertain projects - like human landing on Venus by
2030 or ever finding an ultimate cure for cancer, and the market
just won't be able to put much enough 2 money into them. If even
it did, though, any organization willing to work on the project
would have to borrow a lot of money both for the bets and for
covering its operating costs - for which it would have to
convince the creditors that its estimates are trustworthy, and
then they - not the 'betholders'! - would be responsible for the
quality of their estimates.</P>

<P>If
the size of the market is not big enough - we could call it a
'curiosity market' as opposed to the 'order-for-action market'
described above - it is still very useful, since it encourages
all of the participants to improve their knowledge of the subject
and sharpen their foresight. But even in this case, the market
may fund some practical action. For example, a single scientist,
who feels that the market underestimates the feasibility of some
grand undertaking, can bet for it at a current rate of, e.g., 1
to 30, do some preliminary research, publish its results to
convince other market players, and sell his bets back at the new
rate of, say, 1 to 5, thus handsomely rewarding himself for both
his work and foresight. </P>

<P>Such market funding will be most efficient when the general opinion is
very skeptical about the project. And it is exactly this early
stage in the development of a big project when it can be speeded
up with minimal expenses (as opposed to investing extra billions
of dollars to gain a few months at its end), but no conventional
sources of funding are yet available. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">4. CONTRIBUTIONS TO GOOD PROJECTS </H3>

<P>As
the story with an uncle shows, individuals and organizations
willing to facilitate the development of a certain project can
just place their bets against it - and not only be sure that the
work, if it is at all possible to do it for that money, will be
done by a group with low costs and high chances of success - but
will also draw additional funds from the market, and even receive
some consolation money if the project fails. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">5. DEADLINES AND JURIES</H3>

<P>It
seems that in many cases neither a deadline nor a jury will be
necessary. If the market is now more convinced than before that
some statement is true, it is by itself an opportunity for the
statement's supporters to benefit from their bets, and no
official verifications are needed. To play, one would need to
foresee the shifts in the market's opinions and interests, and
place bets for the statements most likely to soon gain public
confidence. One can also be allowed to withdraw all or a part of
his stake at any time by [an equivalent of] betting against
himself according to the current odds, and then taking away the
money he has put for both sides - without affecting anyone else's
interests. The presence of a jury is costly, complicates the
situation, is unnecessary when the jury agrees with the market's
opinion, and creates conflicts and public discontent when it
doesn't. The checking can still be performed voluntarily by any
group of market players, and they will have all incentives to
make sure that the timing is right, the costs are reasonable, and
the results are convincing. - And this is exactly how other
markets work - the role of regulation being to provide a
framework and enforce the rules, but not to distort the process
itself by any direct involvement - unless it is really necessary.</P>

<P>If a
claim does have a deadline, we can suggest a moratorium on
betting for a certain [considerable] period of time before this
deadline - to prevent the participants from wasting their
far-sighted minds in the final race for the information on the
latest details of the project. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
6. LIMITATIONS OF THE MARKET</H3>

<P>Of
course, the idea of such a market has its limitations and
wouldn't work as simply and ideally as described above. Here is a
list of some of the difficulties I expect to arise (most of them
also apply to, and are more or less successfully resolved in, all
conventional markets), together with some reassuring remarks: </P>

<P>
The market will react on every scientific and popular publication
- just as the stock prices now jump with news and rumors on
events in the Persian Gulf, planned mergers and acquisitions,
fashion changes, etc., which will be advantageous for
short-sighted, but practical people. (But they will have to
seriously study the dynamics of popular scientific beliefs - a
practically untapped and important enough area to let them earn
some money; besides, they will be interested in attracting the
public to scientific and technological discussions).</P>

<P>
The stakes and trading volumes in the market will reflect public
beliefs and interests rather than the best available expertise
and real social needs, and will not necessarily lead the research
in the best directions. (- Well, nothing is perfect. Still, this
market has its benefits, and much useful work can be done under
its control. Meanwhile, the knowledge will flow to the public,
and the money will flow to the wise, both of which mean better
foresight and decision-making in future.) </P>

<P>
The players will have a temptation to pull incompetent people
into the game and even to deliberately mislead the public
opinion. (But, generally speaking, it must be easier to shift the
public opinion in the direction of the truth, than otherwise, and
fraud would be a risky exception, rather than a rule. Besides, we
can expect the other side, as well as thinkers from outside the
market, to present their own arguments, and may hope that both
the subject and the public will only be better off after an
extensive discussion.) </P>

<P>
The process described doesn't make any group accept
responsibility for a project. (But it, just like the stocks and
commodities markets, creates the incentives; and 'responsibility'
is a word that just does not apply to diffuse (market) regulation
systems. So, if you want to make sure that something really gets
done by a certain date, you better sign a contract - or work on
it yourself - with the help of the market's funds.) </P>

<P> In
many cases, market players would be interested in the projects
not being done by the set deadline - with, possibly, some chances
to negatively influence the events. (But there will also be
opposite interests, especially if the problem is of any practical
value - and is not that bad, after all, to have the supporters of
useless projects lose. I wish, though, that 'useful' and
'profitable' meant the same - but that's what we can expect from
any market.) </P>

<P> If
several groups simultaneously decide to do the job, and start
betting, the stakes will rise without promising any of them a
high enough reward to justify the development costs. And the work
would stall. (But after some time, the market will lose faith in
this project and bet against it, thus changing the stakes to make
betting for potential developers more profitable; besides, some
of the groups will quit the game and sell their bets to others to
free cash for other purposes. And even if the funds are
insufficient, it is still an opportunity for a developer to
receive some extra money - and it is certainly better to have a
small help than to have none.)</P>

<P>
Commercializing this sphere of social life means letting Greed
make one more step into the house of Wisdom. The house may just
not look as nice after it. (Though the two have been increasingly
dating since ancient times, and seem to be fairly compatible. And
the closer they were, the faster grew the house.)</P>

<P>
This mechanism by itself will hardly be sufficient for education
on, or funding of, any given subject, and will have to be
carefully integrated with other existing methods of work and
coordinational entities.</P>

<P>But
it is a promising idea, and in my opinion it is well worth
working on; its limitations mean that we have not a panacea, but
only a new organ in the growing social organism - which is just
what one could expect - and with time we'll learn how to use its
benefits and fight its faults. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">7. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS </H3>

<P>The
idea seems to be interesting enough to be presented, after some
home discussion, in a good popular periodical (&quot;Scientific
American&quot;?; &quot;The Futurist&quot;?), which might bring
both wider support and further implementation proposals. I would
suggest to avoid using the word 'bets', however, as giving a
somewhat illegal flavor to the project. Without this word, people
would still enjoy the idea, but those in power will have less
reasons to object. After all, aren't all other markets a kind of
legalized gambling? But they do not carry this name, are
considered to be of public value (at least, in this country), and
obey the law; and so can &quot;the Foresight Market&quot; or
whatever other name may be chosen for it. </P>

<P>The
market can be envisioned to play two major roles: provide funds
and educate the public in new and non-conventional areas of
research. (Old conventional ones are already well (in the sense
of: much) organized and will fiercely and successfully resist it
for quite a while.) Here the market can gain a lot from using the
electronic media - electronic bulletin boards, networks,
distributed Hypertext systems, etc., under the supervision of
special interest groups authorized according to yet inexisting
laws to engage in such market activities. It can merge with other
commercial activities developing in these media, starting from
membership and user fees collection, authors' royalty payments
and electronic banking, and help to collect funds and organize
work in the areas little known to the general public and/or
ignored by the R&amp;D establishment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">8. GENERAL REMARKS </H3>

<P>There
seem to be many areas where the development is considerably
slowed down by the lack of necessary decision-making structures,
where we still actually have various combinations of a few basic
schemes. Many interesting and useful studies and projects, from
morphogenetic fields to nanotechnology to global on-line banks of
software and texts, cannot be implemented by any of these
schemes: they are too difficult for a democracy (with its
increasingly [relatively] incompetent population), too
complicated for an autocracy and too visionary for a bureaucracy
(and, unlike most of the research projects of the relatively
recent past, far too big for any single human genius, if even
s/he is free from most of their organizational limitations). As a
result, the streams of social development flow from these
existing structural spouts, often leaving unexplored islands in
rich intermediate territories - just because the whole process is
blind. If it was not, it would certainly adapt its control
methods to the requirements of the environment, rather than just
trying to spread its tentacles still farther in the same
directions. To do this, and to bring some consciousness into the
process of the mankind's development, we must continue the search
for new and more efficient ways of organization, utilizing the
skills of intelligent and open-minded people and the advantages
of modern technology. </P>

<P>The
<A HREF="http://www.ideosphere.com/">Foresight Market</A> seems to be
a good attempt to advance in this direction. </P>

<P>It
also seems to be the swan song of the market idea, before the
rising wave of planet-wide social integration pushes all markets
into small niches of development regulation network. The global
technostructure is (and will be - at least for a few more
decades) orderly moving along the traditional system integration
paths, and the [relative!] importance of markets as systems of
local checks and balances will diminish while the whole thing
starts looking more like a single organism of high-tech Gaia,
than a loose colony of free independent entities. However, while
eagerly watching this process, we can enjoy the fruits of the
<A HREF="http://www.ideosphere.com/">Foresight Market</A>,
which will only facilitate the transition. </P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">9. GREAT EXPECTATIONS </H3>

<P>Alas,
with social hierarchies turning into networked structures, the
old dream of many great thinkers - to occupy positions on the
[rapidly dissolving] top of this very imperfect society to at
least try to improve it - now looks more like a missed
opportunity. But still we can hope that some day the processes of
social self-organization will put people with foresight into the
positions [in new exterritorial social entities] they deserve.
This market could start this process by letting them (at the long
last!) gain commercial benefits from sharing their wisdom. But
first the thinkers should have money to bet... And some wishful
thinking: since the social and technological progress tends to
eventually exceed our boldest expectations, it seems that we, the
optimists, will tend to gain from the market activities at the
expense of the pessimists - and at the same time will have those
gloomy skeptics fund all of our projects! - Well, you can
recognize an optimist in this forecast. </P>
