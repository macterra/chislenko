Subject:   Support Indian Lottery!
 

 A couple of days ago, NPR reported on a new Indian lottery in U.S.
To play, you dial an 800 number, then give them your credit card number
and get some papers by mail, or something like that.

  They plan to earn about 200 million dollars a year.

The plan has a lot of opposition from people who think their lotteries
may lose money to this one; they say that the indians are going to turn
every phone in the country into a gambling machine. The indians are saying
that all equipment is located on their legal land, and they need money
for "good causes".

  This is quite reminiscent of many Internet and BBS debates.

In all cases, we have some power structures fighting for resources,
using "good memes" as public justification, and referring to outdated
territorial laws and sovereignty rights to control exterritorial
functional processes.

  Looks like they are losing case after case.
This seems natural, as on one side, we have strong interests pushing
the innovation, and one the other, we have opposition with arguments that
have little relevance to the process.

  Taking into account that the functional entities are usually too diverse
and fluid to fall under control of monolithic power structures, this
process could lead to global exterritorial anarchy, leaving territory-born
power structures on rapidly shrinking ground.
