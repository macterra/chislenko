<hr>

<p align="center"><font color="#004080"><u>(This was my first
message on the extropian list) </u></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Limits to computation.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">I once had some absolutely non-practical
idea on how to increase maximal computer speed beyond evident
physical limitations, and hope it is appropriate to share it in
this discussion. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">'Conventional limitations' are
determined by: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080">- the minimal possible size of
    computing elements </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080">- they determine max. density of
    memory, which, at our (my) current knowledge of physics, can
    be put at around 10**100 elements (of Planck, not atomic!
    size) per cubic meter; </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080">- speed of communications (lets
    assume C is the limit) </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080">- architecture - let's think it's
    parallel, and 100% of useful transactions happen between
    physically adjacent computing elements. It gives us (we don't
    care about a few extra orders of magnitude here) 10**40
    operations on each of 10**100 elements = 10**140 ops per
    cubic meter = the ultimate limit to the density of
    intelligence * the volume of the Universe... (I am sure
    though that 1) this kind of intelligence would find further
    ways to improve itself, and 2) we cannot possibly make any
    relevant statement about features of so complex objects) </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080">- Connectedness of the computer. No
    matter how well we arrange the elements, the computer should
    still be an integrated system, which means that any element
    should be able to communicate to any other one, and this
    should take up to a whole cubic light-meter of time per just
    10**100 of complexity... </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#004080">We can remove this last limitation by
effectively increasing the dimensio- nality of the physical
space, which can help squeeze higher volumes into smaller sizes
(diameters) of 'computers'. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">For that, we could create around a
certain point ('center of the computer') a number of space-time
bottle-shaped half-open bubbles (Planckeons). If each of them has
an internal volume of 1 cub.m., and their 'necks' are small
enough to fit, say, a million of them in a 1-meter vicinity of
our center, then we'll have a computing space with a radius of 2
meters and a volume of 1 million cub.m. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">By shrinking the sizes of the necks, and
putting zillions of new bubbles into each bubble, and so on, we
can pack any volume into any size, and thus build a machine with
NO SPEED LIMIT. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">As for the problems with energy
dissipation, we can just close each sub-bubble as soon as we get
the results of the computational task it has been assigned, and
leave the spawned universes digest their own heat, keeping our
master-space clean and cool.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#004080">Well, it all just shows that we can
easily solve theoretical problems with theoretical
technologies... </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">The really interesting problem in
developing extremely sophisticated computers (and other systems),
in my opinion, is the evident fact that humans: </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">1) are increasingly unable to understand
the skyrocketing complexity of developing systems; </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">2) are unwilling to incorporate superior
design techniques into themselves (I did some polling on it),
which is their only chance to catch up, at the expense of the
'human nature' in its narrow human sense. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">3) are not willing to let go of control.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080">This situation cannot last for long, and
it will definitely explode long before the design techniques
reach any fundamental physical limits. </font></p>
