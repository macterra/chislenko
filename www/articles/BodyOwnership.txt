  The traditional definition of concepts of ownership and property includes
the rights of the owner to dispose of it on the conditions *they* get to
set.   This right DEFINES the property, together with the right to use.
(Actually, this is more important than the right to use; you can use the
air, the library, etc... - it's your right to restrict/allow usage of an
object to others - on your conditions! - that defines your property).

  Yes, one can redefine the terms.
  The Soviet ideology which I had a misfortune to familiarize myself with in
a more than theoretical way, invented the distinction between a regular
["bad" and abandoned] PRIVATE property and a new ["good"] *PERSONAL*
property which means the communists got to decide when and how you may
dispose of it.
   This concept was one of the key principles - and practices - of the
Soviet Union; it is this this concept that draws the line between
totalitarianism and a free market society.

   The ideas of the communists were exactly the same as of those people who
do not want to see the market in body parts and services today: it's unfair,
uneven, unethical, it can be abused, we can't allow uncoordinated egotistic
interests to rule such an important thing, etc.

   This concept failed miserably in *all* areas of its application.

   It also is very unnatural and required a lot of coersion in every area of
it's application.

   Fortunately for the humanity, this concept died a painful death
together with all the Soviet Union.    [ Or at least, so I thought... ]

  Bad analogy.

Taking bodies of your parents is the same as taking *their houses*.
Not the same as disposing of *your* body.

   Putting ethics above economics means respecting people's rights over
the economic/social good.  The prohibition to sell organs restricts *both*
the economy and personal liberties.

  I want to have a right to decide myself if, how and when I may use my body
and on what conditions I may dispose of its parts or provide body-related
(i.e. sex) services.  Just like using my non-bilological, exobilological,
memetic and other possessions. The distinction between them is completely in
the minds of the "ethicist" idiots and in the general semantic swamp of the
current human culture.

  I have very different ideas on my personality architechure and know
better how to use it.
  If I find prostitution a less humiliating option than, e.g., a career in
medical ethics, it's up to me.
  The ethicists may feel that I'm entitled to $?00,000 for a liver transplant,
but not to a $700 for a plane ticket to Russia to visit my dying friend or
$800 for a Harvard course in cognitive psychology - but *I* know better what
I need.

   They have no brains to judge my life and no business messing in it.
