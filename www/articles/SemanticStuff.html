<H2>Introduction</H3>

Traditional setup of Denotational semantics: traditional structures are represented
by texts; space of structures is a space of grammar parsings; space
of corresponding meanings of these objects; semantic function [[ ]]
maps structure space into the function space; both spaces are partially
ordered: X <= Y means that we know all information about Y that is known
about X. Functions should be monotonous: the more information is taken
as an input, the more is given as an output.  Also we want that if we
have an increasing sequence than there should be a point that has all
information in these point.  We also want continuity - the function on
the limit is equal to the limit of the function - Scott continuity .
Topology: open set: every point should belong to it together with all
points that are greater or equal to it; also, if the limit of a sequence
belongs to a set, that an end of this sequence should belong to it, too.

There are several hundreds of works where such spaces are built for
simple programming languages, and studying consequences, such as equivalence
of programs.
<P>
Ideally, it would be nice to build a structure that would allow to apply
classical mathematics to programs and their meanings.  There have been no
serious attempts to do it; Michael and Josh suggested generalized metrics
for such spaces; (relaxed metrics") - distance between any objects is an
interval number; if an object is partially defined, then the relaxed distance
between an object and a copy of it is not 0.  Also, there have been some
results in the direction of theory of measure and integrals for such spaces
and relations of relaxed metrics to measures; one of the key open issues is
how to find reasonably effective realization for a given function.

<P>
<H3>Effective complexity of systems</H3>

  Lets look at a structure and a function it implements.
Now lets try to build an optimal structure that realizes the same function
(or an equivalent function).  Now let's estimate the complexity of this
new structure.  We will call it the effective complexity of the original
structure (or any other structure that realizes the same function).
This is also Kolmogorov's complexity of the realized function.
Or in the case of equivalent functions, this would be the minimal
(reasonable) complexity of the first function.
<P>
In the practical case, we would be interested not in the complexity but
in the price of the implementations (considering breaking restrictions
infinitely expensive).
<P>
We may want to consider the distance between the original structure and
one implementing the same function optimally.  Let's call it effectiveness.
We want to measure this distance in the structure space.
We may want to take into account that there are many similar structures.
If we have a limit of distances here, then the structure may have no limit.
If we have several optimal implementations, then the minimal distance should
be chosen.
<P>
If we have two similarly effective structures, than the one with smaller
distance to an optimum would be better - if we want to use distance for
optimization of structures.

<H3>Evolution of structures</H3>

There are two aspects of evolution:

<UL>
<LI>Change
<LI>Estimation of efficiency
</UL>

 In the case of non-intentional evolution, the change happens in the
structure space.  The efficiency is always estimated in the function
space.
<P>
The intentional evolution is different in that in many cases efficient
solutions are already known for some functions.  The solution space
is now "mediated", as for many functions we know decently effective
implementations; let us call such structures "modules".
<P>
In the layered model, the change happens in the module space; of course,
there are still tasks of increasing the set of modules - this is the
intelligence of the evolutionary subject.

<P>Note: in the module-based system, there is also an issue of interfaces.
