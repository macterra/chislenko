<H2>Multi-agent systems and action spaces</H2>

People distinguish various types of systems consisting of relatively
autonomous functional parts. They call them: ecology, economy, society,
organism, software, etc.  The rules for identifying these systems are quite
simple. For example, any system consisting of biological objects would be
called an ecology, one made up of humans is a society, and a part of the
latter that has to do with exchanging things is an economy. However, if one
wants to understand the behavior of such systems (otherwise, why study
them?) it seems more productive to subdivide them into <EM>functional</EM> types.
This also allows to draw analogies between similar systems of different
nature (e.g., a communist economy may be similar to an integrated organism,
as its parts work directly on the central order, and the role of financial
flows is reduced to assist the centralized regulatory mechanism. A contract
economy looks much like a forest ecology, except that agents get locked
into relationships by contracts, not niches, and some other manifestations
of subsystems' intelligence. So multi-agent systems can be classified by
overall complexity, internal control methods, structure and viscosity
(transport capacities) of the space, methods of connecting agents into
stable working groups (mutual specialization, physical coupling, force,
emotional affection, ownership, contracts), diversity and intelligence of
agents, etc.
<P>
A general theory may also help to predict where new systems may have
features qualitatively different from everything previously observed. For
instance, space within modern communication and computing environments is
effectively non-metric (it takes approximately the same time and effort to
phone anybody in a country, or address any memory unit within a computer).
This means that most space-related laws of all previous functional spaces
would not apply to &quot;digital&quot; systems: there is no concept of premium
location here, or differential rent, no &quot;reproductive isolation&quot; or other
influence of space-induced separation on agents' communication and
diversity.  Also digital systems often have lower replication costs of
agents than execution costs, which makes them dramatically different from
all systems more essentially embedded in their physical substrates. - For
humans, it's much easier to translate an article or to fix an appliance
than to transfer the necessary skills to another person. For a computer it
is just copying a program.
<P>
Together, the above features create a foundation for system design that is
dramatically different from all natural and human agglomerations, in terms
of agent specialization, diversity, and deployment.  I would envision the
future intelligence as a collection of highly specialized tools, with
high-bandwidth interconnections, with &quot;personalities&quot;, or complex problem
solvers (&quot;achievers&quot;, &quot;goal engines&quot;, &quot;research tools&quot;, &quot;development
threads&quot;) consisting of limited contractual relations between multiple
problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting entities, that can at the
same time be employed in many other similar relations.  So the entities may
use the same &quot;body parts&quot; on a cooperative or time-sharing basis.

<H2>Economy and beyond</H2>

Economic relations are based on a new class of signaling instruments. By
using quantitative symbols to represent typical value relations between
various resources, economy allows efficient distribution of signals in the
system, and provides short-sighted selfish agents with incentives to adjust
their consumption and production efforts in accordance with the collective
requirements of all other agents in the system.
<P>
While the economy provides its agents with accurate estimates of generic
values of typical goods and services, it has little to offer to each
individual agent in their attempts to estimate the utility of a certain product
for their particular needs, or offer any other personalized or situational
advice.  This kind of knowledge is usually obtained by the economic agents
in about the same way they discovered average social values of common
products and services in pre-economic times: personal experience with the
environment and direct communication with other agents. There are no quantitative
instruments available for automated processing for this purpose.
<P>
This is understandable: comprehensive detailed data about each agent's
behavior so far has not been available in a usable form, communication and
computational tools necessary for processing this data have not been
adequate, transaction costs have been too high, etc. All these obstacles
are now being removed in many systems.
<P>
With these tools in place, there appears a foundation for &quot;a second
signaling mechanism&quot; in an economic system:  together with conventional
aggregate indicators of average costs of resources and services and
their expectations, the new crop of signaling instruments may deliver
suggestions of expected value that particular agents may derive in their
individual situations from such resources or services.  Then agents can
be better equipped to optimize their behavior by using all available
knowledge for comparing personal and global costs, risks, and utilities.
<P>
Systems carrying representations of situational knowledge
(&quot;hyper-economies&quot;, or &quot;super-economies&quot;) may be
implemented in both completely automated environments and those involving
humans (e.g., they could assist people in selection of things most
appropriate for their tastes and situations, from recommending movies they
want to see, to tools that would satisfy <EM>their</EM> needs at the best
price to choosing diets and insurance plans for their own goals and
conditions).
<P>
There is some analogy here with the notion of &quot;psychohistory&quot;
suggested by Isaac Asimov in his Foundation series, except that instead of
using detailed representations of social processes for long-term
prediction of future events (which is hardly possible with a still very
imperfect model of a huge chaotic system), I suggest a more modest goal of
using them for richer local modelling and adaptive control.  The only
advantage here is that this modest goal seems actually achievable.

<H2>From research to development</H2>

I know of a very few people working in similar directions. In the current
situation, good theorists work on conceptualizing existing systems, and
are usually not aware of new developments in software that may create
foundation for new systems and theories. On the other hand, people working
on the first versions of new signaling systems usually do not have much
expertise or interest in theoretical  analysis of complex systems, and
concentrate on debugging and distributing software.  As a result, the
new system structures are arising, once again, unintentionally.
<P>
I am trying to approach this topic both theoretically and experimentally.
<P>
Theoretical part consists of considerations of how the new signaling
systems may change our familiar economic notions, such as capital,
interest, efficiency, liquidity, inflation, emission rights, secondary and
derivative instruments. Some of these features will remain relatively
unchanged but become more liquid (faster distribution and lower transaction
costs) and more efficient. Other parameters may turn from scalar to vector
or a more complex structure (e.g., augmentation of the numerical
representation of value of an object with a matrix of its utilities for
various purposes as estimated by different agents. Some features, such as
non-scalar &quot;situational/detail derivatives&quot; for assessing values
and risks of, and balancing among, particular utilities will be entirely
new.
<P>
Similar changes will happen with the concepts from social and ecological
fields.  Communities do not have to be local anymore, they may have
variable/adaptable geometries, relations between managing and performing
agencies will be redefined, new control structures and dynamic patterns
arise, etc.
<P>
On the experimental side, we are working on simple versions of such systems
in Internet environments, where the data is already available, and the
results seem of direct practical use. Recently, we created a
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/HEDG/HEDG.html">Hyper-Economy Development Group (HEDG)</A>
for modelling such systems. The group is open to interested researchers.
<P>
Among the first applications of this approach I envision large
<A HREF="ACF.html">automated collaborative filtering</A> projects,
<A HREF="http://www.markwelch.com/bannerad/baf_exchange.htm?clicktrade=14528">
link exchange programs</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.markwelch.com/bannerad/ba_network.htm?clicktrade=14528">
targeted advertising</A>, balancing flows of information in accordance
with diverse and dynamic interests of creators, consumers, providers,
and sponsors of the Web content.
<P>
My hope is that eventually such hyper-economic schemes will develop to
store and process increasingly complex representations of agent interests
and utilities, and have a great variety of competing intelligent algorithms
for optimizing system processes, thus turning into a hybrid of an economic
self-regulatory mechanism, complex multifaceted community, and distributed
artificial intelligence, with secondary data representation and signaling
mechanisms forming emerging self-awareness of the new systems.
<P>
It seems noteworthy that in these constructs, as well as in conventional
economy, the meta-signaling [generalized/abstract in relation to actual
&quot;field agents&quot;] level is represented in terms of signal currents in the
semantic space rather than crisp symbolic constructs. We can interpret this
as a sign that the connectionist approach is natural for a fetal stage of
any system intelligence.  Or - better - that a combination of symbolic
processing with signal flow patterns will extend the human balance of
symbolic reasoning and intuition to further levels of intelligence.

<H2>Examples</H2>

A few examples on how one may combine general, specialized (or
situation-specific) knowledge:  (actually, there is hardly any absolutely
general knowledge that is equally applicable to all situations; in many
cases, situational advice may consist of references to relevant general
knowledge).
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Recommendation systems for consumer items:</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>The price of an item, such as a book, an instrument, or a travel
package, may be taken from the general catalog. The estimates of utility of
this items would come from the collective experience of other people with
similar needs and interests who have experience with this or similar items.
Some computational constructs needed for summarizing and delivering
situational knowledge, such as utility trends on item/consumer clusters,
vectors of refined &quot;eigen-preferences&quot;, etc., represent hyper-economic
equivalents of secondary and derivative signaling instruments in the
conventional economy.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Targeted advertising:</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>The same mechanisms that can advise items to consumers, may suggest
potential consumers to manufacturers of these items.  In the current
situation, an advertiser knows the exact price of the ad delivery, but
targeting of ads is usually very costly and inaccurate.  As a result, most
of the multi-billion-dollar advertising industry efforts miss their targets
and annoy people, while knowledge of many good products doesn't reach the
individuals who may benefit from them. An advanced mechanism for combining
and sharing (for a price) metabolites of advertising and sales information
of all companies would result in more efficient proliferation of useful
goods and services and dramatic reduction of targeting costs.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Computational heuristics:</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>In a large AI system, computational/royalty costs for all algorithms
may be known, but it is also important to estimate the expected benefits of
applying each algorithm to each problem. In an &quot;intelligent soup&quot; of a
&quot;market AI&quot; system, multiple problem generators and solvers can share not
just information on the current value and availability of computational
resources, but also suggestions of what methods appear to be of the highest
utility for what problems, and how they may be better applied.
