  Automated Collaborative Filtering of information (ACF) is an unprecedented technology for distribution of opinions and ideas in society and facilitating contacts between people with similar interests.  It automates and enhances existing mechani
sms of knowledge distribution and dramatically increases their speed and efficiency.  This allows to optimize knowledge flow in the society and accelerate the evolution of ideas in practically all subject areas.  ACF also provides a superior tool for info
rmation retrieval systems that facilitates users\rquote  navigation in the sea of information in a meaningful and personalized way.  This technology can be viewed as a }{\i\f0\fs24 semantic transport}{\f0\fs24  \endash 
 a social utility that, after physical and data transports, transfers increa
singly abstract and intelligent objects between previously isolated fragments of the social organism.  As an artificial system that integrates and processes knowledge of multiple human participants, ACF represents an intermediate stage between  human and 
p
urely artificial intelligence and lays the foundation for the future knowledge processing industry.  This article discusses the premises and the historical analogs of  ACF technology and suggests its possible uses as well as long-term economic and social 
implications.}{\b\f0\fs24

\par 
\par }{\f0\fs22    Social mechanisms of knowledge distribution represent a formative factor for all spheres of social life. It is the advantages of sharing knowledge a
mong individuals that, together with benefits of group work, led to the development of language, symbolic thinking, and specialization of labor.  The rate of social progress is to a large degree determined by the availability of standardized and affordabl
e
 communication tools. The transaction costs of the social communication infrastructure define the scales and interrelations of social institutions. Effective mechanisms for collecting and publishing aggregate opinions of the population are a crucial facto
r for democratic governance; similar mechanisms for establishing balanced product and share prices form a signaling foundation of a market economy. 
\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs22   }{\b\f0\fs24 Collaborative filtering of information}{\f0\fs22 
\par 
\par   While generalized, or aggregate, information is essential for b
alancing social processes on the macro-scale, it is usually not sufficient for suggesting optimal behavior to any particular person.  For making efficient personal selections, people have to possess both necessary general knowledge and special information
 
relevant to their particular situation.  For collecting necessary information, one has to choose what objects to pay attention to.   In early human history, each person was familiar with the whole environment and, after gaining experience with most availa
b
le things and people, could decide what to explore further. However, this strategy cannot work in a more complex society, when one is faced with more objects and people than he can even sample.  This situation requires exchange of personal experience amon
g individuals and sharing personal advice on many particular issues. If a person needs to make a decision in an unknown situation, he can talk to his friends, and follow their suggestions.  Here, one\rquote 
s circle of acquaintances effectively plays the role of an information filter, suggesting most relevant options and leads for further exploration.
\par 
\par   With increasing variety of areas of expertise and value judgments, the opinions of a few chosen individuals and the averaged opinion of the society become insuffic
ient for providing advice for all of one's decisions.   In this situation, larger-scale collaboration in information filtering becomes increasingly important. Individuals seeking advice query people with similar interests whom they trust, collect their op
i
nions and choose the options selected by the majority of the most knowledgeable people. This is very often the way we select places for vacation, books, movies, or restaurants.  If none of the people we ask have any experience with a specific item, some o
f
 them may still know something about it, if they have heard about it from others. If someone cannot recommend an item of interest, they may still be able to refer us to another person who we may ask about it. This is the "word of mouth" method of informat
ion distribution in a society.

\par   Querying people is a useful method for finding information when you know you need it, or when you think something new might have appeared. This method may be called \ldblquote user pull\rdblquote , as you have
 to expend an effort to pull the knowledge out of the passive environment. However, it is not always sufficient, especially in cases when you do not know what questions to ask, or something totally new has happened, or your contacts find out something the
y couldn't have told you about before.
\par 
\par  }{\i\f0\fs22   Active collaborative }{\f0\fs22 helps you in such cases, by bringing you information you need when someone in your community discovers it. Information can "find" you in two ways.  First, you can ask people to let you know whe
never they learn something exciting, new, or relevant in some area.  Second, people who know you can share information if they decide you can benefit from it.  In both cases, after learning about your  needs or preferences, members of the community take a
n active role in supplying you with important knowledge. We can say that the community actively \ldblquote pushes\rdblquote  the information towards you.

\par    }{\b\f0\fs28 Limitations of existing filtering methods
\par }{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    Traditional methods of knowledge distribution become very inefficient 
when the size and complexity of a society far outpace the ability of anyone's circle of acquaintances to monitor events.  The modern communication system transmits billions of messages daily, and many of them may be of great interest to you.  You can also
 
easily access any of the millions of available books, magazines, songs, movies or Internet resources.  However, finding people who have looked at the things you may like and whose opinions you might trust can be very difficult.  You do not know most of th
ese people, so you can not hope that they will know \endash  or care \endash 
  to tell you when they find something of interest to you.  Even if you could overcome these difficulties, it would still be impossible to retain opinions of thousands of people in your mind and decide which of them to follow.
\par 
\par   The hope here rests on machines.  In their evolution as knowledge carriers machines have repeated  the early stages of the development of human information sharing techniques.  They have been taking an increasing role in
 storage, transmission and averaging of opinions.  Now it is time for machines to take on the more sophisticated tasks of automated information filtering.

\par 
\par   When too much information exists, reliance on human connections for finding exactly what you want becomes inefficient, because people, smart as they are, have limited capacity to store and share information. 
\par 
\par   The traditional solution to this problem has been to store data outside the human mind, and let peopl
e search through it. Recently, with the advent of computer systems, machines also began performing searches for information. So now information seekers have two kinds of helpers:   people who can understand your interests, but are slow and inefficient in 
handling data; and computers that are fast and cheap, but still too stupid to understand the meaning of the material and judge what is good and relevant.  Still, we want help that is both fast and intelligent.
\par 
\par   Attempts to speed up humans or smarten machi
nes have not been too successful thus far.  The solution that allows us to perform information searches with human intelligence and at machine speeds, however, is relatively simple: record people's opinions on the importance and quality of the material, a
nd use these records to improve the results of computer searches.  This technology is called Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF). It can also be viewed as an example of Synthetic Intelligence (SI) \endash 
 a system combining human and machine knowledge process
ing strengths.  ACF allows people to find others with similar opinions, discover experts in a field, analyze the structure of people's interests in various subject domains, facilitate creation of interest groups, decentralize communication media, improve 
t
argeting of announcements and advertisements, and do many other useful things that, together with other intelligent technologies, promise to bring the information economy to new levels.  As distribution of opinions does not require knowing the physical id
entity of the persons sharing and receiving advice, the automated filtering systems (with appropriate software tools) may become the most secure channel of knowledge sharing in history.
\par }{\f0\fs24 \page     }{\b\f0\fs32\cf1 Historical Stages: Physical, data, and semantic transports}{\b\f0\fs24 
\par }{\b\f0\fs22 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 Ancient history: Physical transports.}{\f0\fs22 
\par 
\par   The creation of the physical transport system was, in a sense, analogous to the development of mobile organisms.  The difference is that in an ecology, organisms move around looking for resources; in an economy, resources
 usually get delivered to organisms, which is a smarter way to connect them in complex systems. The important point here is that ultimately, the transport function shifts from the organisms to synthetic (technological) systems.
\par 
\par   Transport systems modify 
the effective geometry  of the environment.  The important metric in the social space is how much time and resources it takes to move things from one place to another. We could create a map of a territory, "distorted" so that the distance between two poin
t
s is proportional to the time (or cost) of traveling between these points. If we use such a map to track the evolution of the transportation system, we will see that with time, distances contract in all directions, most rapidly along the most important co
n
nections.  Small improvements in the quality of vehicles and infrastructure reflect the general contraction of the space metrics; new roads and transport methods represent structural changes in geometry and even topology of the social space. We can visual
i
ze this impact as new dimensions added to the space or new shortcuts opened between various objects. Advanced transportation infrastructure creates a social circulatory system that helps transform a set of isolated production locales into an integrated ec
onomic environment.
\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 Modern history: data/signal transports}{\f0\fs22 
\par 
\par    Since there is a great variety of resources to move and travel to, a new problem arises \endash  }{\i\f0\fs22 knowing }{\f0\fs22 what to get and how to handle it.  Some of this knowledge is embedded in our bodies. In other c
ases, organisms' generic biological skills can be utilized by the social system.  So humans spend a good part of their history memorizing and sharing ways to handle things \endash 
 eventually overloading their ability to exchange information. People may be near the objects they need, but they can not see them directly, or get advice from others \endash 
 and so they cannot utilize important resources.  People may be able to create necessary artifacts and transport them to places where they are needed, but often they  cann
ot do so, as they do not know what to create and where they should deliver the products. As a result, the social space is divided into a set of functional fragments reflecting  existing information pools, even though good transportation systems make the p
hysical environment relatively liquid.
\par 
\par    To ameliorate this situation, people improve their artificial ways of storing and transmitting data.  Efficient information exchange mechanisms re-integrate the economic space, and accelerate economic progress beyo
nd what physical transport could do alone. These mechanisms also allow further leaps in complexity. Now, with today's sophisticated information technology that can transport data electronically as well as physically, people just have to decide who and wha
t to contact; the technological tools allow people to maintain relationships with distant objects, organizations and friends as if they were located next to them.
\par 
\par   Consequential benefits of this stage include greater economic efficiency, faster growth, de
mise of territorial sovereignty, and shift of importance to functional power centers.  As conflicts migrate from territorial to functional structures, weapons change from guns to words and bank accounts.  Informational entities are torn apart daily in int
ense economic and cultural competition, while physical bodies feel less pain. Deterritorialization of power structures and obsolescence of the territorial/physical warfare between advanced economies are among the benefits of the information revolution.

\par 
\par   Topologically, the effect of fast signal transports is equivalent to the collapse of the social space metric along established social connections.
\par 
\par   In the distant future, we may learn how to cost-effectively synthesize any physical artifact on the spot (e
.g., by nanoassembly or manipulation of vacuum microstructure), and send high-bandwidth signals at light speed between any two points. Then, the physical space will effectively collapse, and its intrinsic topology will be of as little interest to system d
e
signers as details of physical representation of bits are to today's software engineers. The 15-billion-year struggle of functional structures for independence from physical substrate that is now experiencing such a magnificent growth spurt, will be mostl
y complete, allowing the world to finally concentrate on its real tasks \endash  development  of complex, balanced, flexible systems not limited by the shortcomings of any particular substrate.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 
\par  Further development: Semantic transports}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    Now we encounter the ne
xt obstacle:  so much data, so many signals. Even the powerful machines are overloaded with data.  Information traffic, partly due to its relatively low cost, becomes horribly inefficient. Many media, from newspapers to USENET, try to send everything to e
verybody.  As a result, while people already read as much as they possibly can, most of the increase in information traffic is never read. A typical reader of }{\i\f0\fs22 New York Times}{\f0\fs22 
 may read 5% of the paper, and a typical reader of USENET may consume 0.01% of the d
aily news traffic coming to his server. (Multimedia gives a one-time increase in bandwidth demand, but the main tendency is still the same). The "Internet visionaries" debate whether increased capacities of physical cables may provide the projected increa
s
e in data  transfer, and billions of dollars are spent on attempting to fix information problems using physical methods.  That's a  step back by a level!  Instead, we should move a level forward and look at the message semantics.  Then, we could transmit 
only the messages that are actually going to be read. 
\par 
\par    The problem here is that while machines store and pass messages, they do not know what to store and where to pass it.  So, they  process everything.  Humans understand what to handle, and how to han
dle it. But people's semantic abilities are at least as limited as their skills in handling material objects and storing and transmitting data, so each person has to specialize in a few isolated areas of opinions and expertise. Communication between these
 areas is imperfect because of semantic barriers \endash 
 most people do not know each other, the organizational mechanisms of knowledge transfer between domains are relatively weak, and terminology and interests differ (conditions of "reproductive isolation" in the memetic ecology).
\par 
\par    The }{\i\f0\fs22 semantic}{\f0\fs22 
 space is fragmented, though the information environment is liquid.  So here we face a task similar to the one that led to the creation of the [signal] communication industry:  to build a semantic transport system that 
would take an increasing role in determining what data should be stored and where, who should get signals and from which sources, and how to structure social mechanisms.
\par 
\par    In this scenario, machines begin by collecting data from people about what they kn
ow, have, like and want, and assist in figuring out what kinds of connections should be made. Then, the machines can suggest these connections to humans ("check out X!") or partly execute selected transactions ("Here is something you may want to know/do" 
\endash 
 that is, machine chooses the source, and you decide whether you want to be the recipient, or vice versa).  Machines can even act independently for your benefit, e.g., perform market transactions on your behalf, or upgrade your computer with a program lik
ed by similar users \endash  according, of course, to your preferences and instructions.
\par 
\par   Consequences here are similar to those of the data revolution, but on another level: growing semantic liquidity and integration, higher effective complexity of the social e
nvironment, and even faster growth.  At the advanced stage of this process, humans may play the role of "semantic sensors", assessing the meaning and value of objects in their vicinity, and letting machines organize the global architecture of value flows.

\par 
\par   This is virtually opposite to the human role in a primitive physical economy: then, measuring and sensing devices (thermometers, clocks, watchdogs) played specialized roles in monitoring and enhancing the environment, while humans determined the system 
architecture and provided general support and coordination.  But now, humans specialize in creating particular artifacts and assessing their quality, and the machine economy provides the general structure. (At this point, most of the architectural structu
re of the economy is non-biological, so its further de-humanization should be relatively painless.)
\par 
\par    It is likely that semantic transport will play as important a role in the advanced information economy as signal and physical transports played in the in
dustrial age.  Twenty percent of the global economy by the year 2030? This may sound like an exaggeration.  However, people already spend at least as large a share of their time and effort on collecting and sharing expertise. What is needed here is automa
t
ion of this process.  If we look at the acceleration of automation and data processing and extrapolate the trend, 30 years may seem sufficient for development of a knowledge processing industry.  We can hardly expect that collection, distribution and shar
ing of expertise \endash  the most valuable social resource in the coming era \endash 
 would be done by unpaid and unorganized enthusiasts in their spare from other tasks time, without assessing costs and benefits.  Most likely, effective cooperation among contributors a
nd beneficiaries of knowledge flows will call for more wide-spread usage of value accounting, and ultimately build the }{\i\f0\fs22 wisdom economy }{\f0\fs22 of the future.
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 \page 
\par   Trends in the evolution of transports}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    The distinctions of physical, data and semantic transports ma
y seem somewhat forced, as would any other simple subdivision of a complex process. The fact remains that exo-biological systems take an ever increasing role in storing, transporting and processing structures valuable for biological individuals, and the i
n
volvement of the technology  in these functions is ever more active and intelligent.  A wheelbarrow filled with stone tablets already represents an external mobile transport of abstract references, although the message is still too deeply engraved in the 
m
edium, and the whole transport is passive and unaware of its function. During the course of history, value transports become increasingly abstract, changing physical carriers without human involvement, testing their own integrity and assuring delivery, pr
o
cessing the entrusted values, and ultimately, accepting a greater role in deciding what should be shared, where it should be sent, and how it should be processed.  To build this new semantic transport, we need to create the global information infrastructu
r
e, with open standards for semantically rich descriptions of objects and their relations allowing for diversity of opinions on the same subjects and access control for different parties. We also need comprehensive feature and interest ontologies, to descr
ibe the structure of the environment, a variety of algorithms that would form the brain of this system, and an extensive amount of knowledge loaded into it by multiple participants.
\par 
\par   The development of technology in any area goes through a similar set of 
stages. At each stage a new level of human abilities first becomes explicitly expressed in non-biological constructs, then independently carried, then carried out (all things that are started by humans and continue functioning on their behalf, from campfi
r
es to mousetraps to stock trading programs), then combined and processed, then get taken over. This has already happened, consecutively, with the handling of physical materials, energy, and raw information.  Pursuit of AI, though a worthy goal, may have b
e
en an attempt to leapfrog the natural cooperative/mixed/synthetic stage in the area of object semantics. Now we are filling this gap. Human judgments have been expressed in artificial media for a long time, communication industry gave us efficient tools f
o
r transporting them. Automated processing of opinions is still in a very primitive stage (e.g., ballot counting systems), but ACF technology promises to significantly raise its level. After this is accomplished, the next  layer of human functionality  to 
b
e taken over will probably be semantic analysis of objects.  The work here has already begun, with pattern recognition and signal processing techniques, and commonsense information analysis tools on the higher end. Existence of semantic transport infrastr
u
cture will allow immediate utilization of advances in automated semantic analysis, which should greatly accelerate its development.  An analog here is text analysis tools that after the emergence of the World Wide Web became crucial for daily information 
searches of millions of people, and turned information retrieval from an area of orderly academic activity into an arena of intense commercial competition.

\par   }{\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs22  Strictly speaking, ACF, as well as data communications, starts with transporting }{\i\f0\fs22 references}{\f0\fs22 
 to existing values, rather than the values themselves. Reference transport optimizes the flows of underlying values. This allows references themselves to be recognized as values, and then the new mechanism turns into 
a value transport in the full sense. In the current society, though money can be easily passed from one agency to another, many crucial areas of economic and social activity are under-funded,  as their importance is not recognized (though all necessary in
f
ormation may be available somewhere, it can remain unknown or ignored by people with money).  In many cases, people have no incentive to share their knowledge with others, as in many areas there are no mechanisms to compensate them for sharing the knowled
g
e.  So instead of just telling other people what they know, which would be the least expensive way to provide the maximal social benefit, they attempt to realize that knowledge in something non-transportable, so that they can control the distribution of b
e
nefits and profit from it (though these implementations often could be realized faster and cheaper by other people if they knew about them). The creation of reward mechanisms for knowledge distribution, in terms of enhanced social reputation of the indivi
dual, as well as direct payment for advice based on the utility of previous opinions expressed by the same person, may give people incentives to share some of the knowledge \endash  e.g., observations of the economy, or ideas for inventions \endash 
 in the areas where they tend to keep information proprietary today.  This would result in less antagonistic relationships between an individual and society, conservation of resources, and acceleration of progress.

\par    Applications of ACF in the near future}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par   ACF provides multiple functions.  Let us examine them and see how they may be used}{\f0\fs24 .
\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24    Finding objects of desire}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par   People spend a lot of time trying to find the best objects to satisfy their interests. In the process, they waste a lot of effort looking through junk, fin
d some occasional surprises (serendipity is a side benefit of bad searches), and miss many gems that might have made their lives much better. Email and Web access dramatically increased the efficiency of information searches and distribution, but did not 
modify the nature of the mechanisms.  Improving this search process would increase quality of life and accelerate the adoption of new and worthy products and ideas.  This would save resources and increase the rate of social and economic progress.
\par 
\par    An int
eresting issue here is that recommendations delivered by ACF come from the person's affinity groups, and are more geared towards the person's interests than suggestions from mass-media channels, whose choice recommendations are linked to the power interes
t
s of a small number of commercial and political organizations. This could very well lead to decentralization and democratization of influential powers in the society, even for mainstream interests. I would like to stress that I divide interests into fring
e
 and mainstream here, not people. For example, my interest in philosophy may be fringe, but my health and nutrition interests may be quite typical.  I would expect that the ACF-enhanced system would be more likely to recommend apple juice over Coca-Cola t
h
an would commercial advertising. The effect on the economy should be a greater incentive for companies to tailor both their products and marketing messages to consumer interests rather than to manipulate people's opinions. "Producer push" in value exchang
es would give some space to "consumer pull".
\par 
\par    Implications for fringe interests are still more promising. People who are interested in rare objects or obscure issues usually get no social messages targeted at them at all.  ACF may provide them with advic
e whose quality matches that of wider spheres of interest.  ACF can also benefit people who have interests in the mainstream subjects, but who have opinions different from those of others \endash 
 they may be trying to do something new, or have finer or exotic ta
stes.  For these individuals, ACF can deliver advice corresponding to their preferences. Such functions will allow ACF systems to support the diversity of tastes and interests and encourage their development, while preventing alienation.
\par 
\par   Some caveats ex
ist here as well.  If people's expertise and tastes in some area are underdeveloped, a straightforward ACF system might provide them with the advice of their "laggard" affinity group that may give them support but not help in developing beyond their curre
nt level.

n, ACF technology as an information search method will join the ranks of established information retrieval tools, and will make information retrieval systems more intelligent and adaptable. Increasingly semantics-rich information systems will include elem
e
nts of ACF functionality as integral parts, and will use them to adjust their communications with humans and each other, building representations of the environment more suitable for their tasks. This includes negotiation of "consensus ontologies" for dif
ferent subject areas, and building models of people's interests that would help refine searches for information.  Later, automated content analysis tools based on \ldblquote common sense knowledge bases\rdblquote 
 may aid humans in evaluating item semantics.
\par 
\par   The ACF methods
 should not necessarily be based on the straightforward matching of people's interests.  One group of people can be interested in materials that another group considers offensive or controversial; educators would pay special attention to things that stude
n
ts find too difficult or boring; researchers may be interested in problems that have puzzled their colleagues or have not received sufficient attention; social scientists and market analysts would study subjects experiencing rapid changes in levels of pub
l
ic interest or shifts of opinions; reviewers would look for new or unknown material in promising areas; fashion watchers may pay attention to things rising in popularity. As a result, the ecology of knowledge may establish productive information exchanges
 among  groups that previously didn't find much in common. (Let us hope that this information will not be used for hostile purposes too often).
\par }{\b\f0\fs22 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24   Finding like-minded people}{\f0\fs24    
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    This is a very important function of ACF, just as it is of many social mechanisms.  Finding people who share your interests is important for finding further directions in life, starting social and economic activities, forming friendships and families, 
}{\f0\fs22\cf1 getting advice on important personal decisions}{\i\f0\fs22 , }{\f0\fs22 and feeling more confident and s
table in the social environment. Many people abandon ideas of businesses or social undertakings, or feel depressed and alienated only because they cannot find other individuals who share their interests, even though those people may pass them in the stree
t, or could be reached in a few seconds with a phone call.  ACF can help you find kindred spirits wherever you go \endash 
 just express your preferences, and you will find that the person in the next theater seat shares your interests in the arts, that your neighb
or at a business banquet table is thinking of hiring somebody with your qualifications, and that the person in the airplane seat next to yours is single, fits all your dating criteria and shares your political affiliations and musical tastes.  Some day, y
ou might even be able to find people sharing such bizarre interests as the historical subject of social alienation in the pre-ACF era.
\par 
\par   The social functions of ACF can be supplemented by other Automated Collaboration (AC) techniques, such as group scheduling, multi-user games, teleconferencing, groupware, etc., that would facilitate all kinds of activities among like-minded people.

\par }{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24    Finding people who may like a certain object or idea}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    The mechanism that refers people to things and ideas they may lik
e, may also work the other way, to help things and ideas find people who may like them. So it may be not clear whether the whole process will help people pursue things, or help things to pursue people.  In any thing-person encounter, the beneficiary is so
m
e interest that may or may not reside within that person.  If this interest is friendly to the recipient of the connection, we have the previously described optimistic scenarios. However, the interest may easily be hostile or manipulative.  One may imagin
e
 personalized ads that would suggest snake oil to the people who are most likely to be gullible, at the maximum price they could pay for it, or political campaigns where the message delivered to each citizen will say exactly what this person "needs" to he
a
r to decide in favor of this particular politician, and various other versions of "personalized truth" and manipulative messages.  Considering that the development of ACF, just as most other technologies, is propelled by pursuit of commercial gains and po
wer more than by search for truth and general social progress, this potential is quite alarming.
\par 
\par }{\f0\fs24    }{\b\f0\fs32 Social consequences of ACF}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par     Historically, the development of physical and signal transports has led to democratization of these areas; travel and commun
ication are widely available in developed countries, and the gap between the elite and the general populace now is narrower than ever. However, the development of the industrial and information economies was far from peaceful and democratic, and was chara
c
terized by huge inequalities and other unpleasant phenomena, from wars over resources to mass brainwashing. In the end, the social powers came to a new equilibrium, and the grass-roots power of the increasingly well informed populace balanced the stronger
 but indiscriminate influence of new political and economic elites.
\par 
\par   Could the new industry of personalized knowledge delivery overpower the existing mechanisms of grass-roots communications and upset this historical balance?  Maybe we will be lucky, and 
the logic of the next stage of technological development will magically coincide with general interests of  humankind and the needs of social progress and stability. But, this has never happened before.  Or, perhaps, people will wake up and pass their dev
elopment powers to benevolent visionaries.  This has never happened either...
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 \page 
\par 
\par   A pessimistic scenario:
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    People will find themselves surrounded by a host of intelligent reactive information systems.  Most people will have no idea of what is going on, 
and everybody will just hope that they can find some value in the new situation, while tolerating the bad effects.  Governments and businesses will develop semi-intelligent solutions with predictable economic efficiency (different for these two), but most
l
y with localized benefits and random social effects. People who prefer emotional stability to intellectual growth will form comfortably stagnant communities and shield themselves from disturbing and challenging influences. Fringe sociopathic people with p
erverse interests will for the first time find secure and efficient ways to organize and communicate. The governments will cite the \ldblquote urgent necessity\rdblquote 
 of protecting some obscure parts of the population from whatever the officials consider criminal, and pres
sure the system to incorporate snooping technologies and censoring rules. Politicians and marketers will do their best to brainwash the population. Socially responsible thinkers will play about as little a role as they ever did.
\par 
\par    Still, ACF can do something for visionaries, too: it can help them form their own common interest groups on the semantic fringes of the society, and the wise folks will at least have some pleasure jointly observing the events.
\par 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24 The preferred scenario:}{\f0\fs24   
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par     ACF systems will pro
vide a responsive semantic network designed by people and for people, as an expression of their interests and aspirations. Ideas coming from incompetent or malevolent forces will get caught in the global memetic sieve before they could influence a sizable
 
part of the population. Good and useful ideas and opinions will proliferate and be distributed with unprecedented speed to all who need them, while people who produce and recommend these ideas will earn great respect from their audiences, further increasi
ng their ability to influence events.
\par 
\par   Life will most likely be more complex than these scenarios, especially if one considers that ACF will never be the sole factor shaping the society.  Whether ACF may soon start offering strong positive contributions t
o the lives of many people depends largely on the vision and efforts of the people who develop and promote this technology.

\par  Managing personal resources}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    A common problem in an advanced society, and one that has not received sufficient attention because of lack of commercial interest, is that of ubiquitous }{\i\f0\fs22 junk}{\f0\fs22 
. In the good old cave times, keeping track of one's few belongings was easy; today, people seem to be drowning under piles of personal possessions. The pro
blem becomes even more difficult with data objects, as low delivery costs and virtually unlimited storage potential make the accumulation of one's intellectual possessions overwhelming, while efficient handling of personal information becomes more and mor
e crucial.
\par 
\par    A typical personal computer today contains several thousand files, many of which have hundreds or thousands of records. Without effective management, these information repositories are becoming "write-only memory".  The evolution of managing 
methods here is repeating the path of larger systems. Originally, people just remembered all their files.  Then, the software allowed organized storage and searches for data.  The recent generation of PIMs \endash  Personal Information Managers \endash 
 allows for more 
flexible and meaningful organization of personal information.  However, the task of classifying and managing thousands of aging pieces of information on a PC becomes a challenge even for a seasoned professional.  The "Miscellaneous" category acquires thou
sands of diverse materials; searches by keywords become difficult ("What was that thing that I got recently from some good friend of mine that I thought I'd do something with?" \endash  try this with keywords!)  In many cases, one doesn\rquote 
t even remember to look for something...
\par 
\par    Intelligent software agents promise to alleviate these problems by remembering all activity on a computer, deriving patterns from the user's behavior to help classify and prioritize messages and otherwise manage their "external memory".  
But here we face the usual hard problems of building good AI. At this point, PC intelligence is far too limited to build reasonable classifications of data and figuring out which messages are important, except for a few cases with usual topics and regular
 correspondents.  Even with good intelligence, users wouldn't receive very useful advice, if an agent's knowledge is derived only from one user's limited personal experience.
\par 
\par    The first generation of software for managing personal resources has already a
ppeared on the market. The next stage may be expected to include elements of ACF, such as recorded opinions of human experts in one's sphere of interests, recommendations of like-minded people, and object classification and information retrieval rules der
i
ved from their personal information-handling patterns by their own software agents. From this stage, the software servants may be constantly at work exchanging experiences with each other, generalizing it for related groups of tasks, negotiating subject o
ntologies, etc.  With time, most of the "semantic traffic" will consist of messages created by one machine for the consumption of others, as has already happened with storage, transportation and processing of physical materials, energy and information.

\par 
\par    
 With good information protection technologies, people could trust the large servers with storage of their personal data, to ensure its security and accessibility from anywhere in the world. Then, the search for personal information can be provided by the
 same tools as the global or company-wide search, with consideration of access rights.
\par 
\par     Eventually, the knowledge of our habits and preferences will be distributed in, or available to, all our tangible possessions, from the toaster to the walls of our h
ouses.  As appliances acquire the physical and intellectual skills necessary for physical mobility \endash  make the transition analogous to that between plants and animals \endash 
 the benefits of information processing we have been discussing will extend to include ma
nipulation of physical objects.  Mobile possessions will rearrange themselves and other appliances for our convenience, discover and bring us things we may consider of interest, take us to destinations, and drive along the paths, that we are likely to enj
oy the most.

\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par     With a natural progression of a human from a biological creature to a relatively individual tool manipulator to a part of a technological system, the perception of human value shifted correspondingly \endash  from b
odily strengths, to the amount of personal possessions, to the value of knowledge and experience necessary for taking part in an integrated economy. In today's economy, reputation \endash 
 the perception by the community of the utility of one's socially productive skills \endash 
 often represents the single most valuable asset of a person or an organization and plays an important role in most social and economic interactions.  However, there has been little intentional effort to widen the use of this important social too
l.  ACF technology can make a considerable contribution here, collecting, maintaining and distributing knowledge of people's reputations.
\par }{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\b\f0\fs24   Example of reputations: People's Better Business Bureau / Consumer reports}{\f0\fs24 
\par }{\f0\fs22 
\par    Many people feel suspicious of plumb
ers and car mechanics, as they tend to under-perform and overcharge.  However, these people do not have different DNA from everybody else's, and their occupations are not legally limited to the members of the National Crook Guild.  The problem is that the
s
e businesses have little incentive to perform more responsibly. The customer does not have sufficient expertise to personally control the work of these people, and usually has no access to the opinions of previous customers regarding their services. The b
usiness then does not feel motivated enough to give the customer the best service and price, as the excess charges would enrich it directly, while the negative opinion of the customer is unlikely to repel other potential clients.
\par 
\par    This situation would ch
ange dramatically if the opinions on previous jobs became publicly accessible.  If you need to get any service, you would ask the ACF system for a list of business evaluations, and select the service based on the combined knowledge of people similar to yo
u in income, place of residence, service requirements, and cultural preferences.
\par 
\par   The system is not necessarily immune from abuse, as bad servicemen might ask their friends to enter fake references for their businesses. However, people whose recommendations appear misleading, would see their own reputations \endash  and influences 
\endash  decrease in the system.  This would provide an incentive to people to be truthful, and will make sure that people who tend to give bad advice, will not harm others too much.  If the s
ystem rewards the providers of good advice (would you pay 25 cents for a reference to the most experienced and honest car mechanic in your area?), then people with the most valuable consumer expertise may find themselves employed as paid consumer advisors
.  If the system can transport values, it can transport rewards as well \endash  collection and distribution of incentives for providing useful references and reviews may become a key part of a collaborative system ensuring "positive value feedback".

\f0\fs22 .  The \ldblquote brand awareness\rdblquote 
 is often built by massive advertising that wins one company or product a place in the limited consumer memory, at the expense of other brands. This familiarity with the brand often depends more on the size of the company and its advertising bud

a
ls with cheaper and superior products from gaining the recognition they deserve. As better mechanisms for product recommendations appear, we may see brand advertising drift towards obsoletion, as the products will be judged and recommended based on their 
a
ctual values and costs.  The general reputation of a company or a product line would still be important, as they would provide additional guarantees of consumer service and product quality, which is especially important for introduction of new products to
 the market.  However, this reputation will be built more on the consumers\rquote  aggregate opinion on the quality of the product, than on the all-too-familiar non-informative ads.  In many cases, especially for new products, in addition to \endash 
 or even instead of \endash  the producer\rquote s reputation, the consumer would rely on the reputation of the }{\i\f0\fs22 critics}{\f0\fs22  \endash

om a message if it\rquote 
s attention is not arrested within a few seconds.  As a result, the attention span of the populace takes a historically unprecedented plunge, while the social environment becomes filled with shocking people and shocking issues, which do n
ot necessarily have anything to do with real values or problems.   Perceptual shocks satisfy consumers by tickling their natural senses, and reinforce the dominance of perception manipulators over value creators in both political and economic decision-mak

imperative turns in the positive direction.  So, unlike a socium controlled by visionary villains, our situation at least has a chance to be improved by dumb luck\'85

 and also how much resources (time, money or other projects) they would sacrific
e to make sure this project is implemented (or prevented) and who they would trust to perform the work.  If there is a social agreement, the project would start.  The role of ACF in this process would be distribution of the initial suggestions to people w

 the user interact with multiple features of the item, we may want to cluster item features and user interests into functional vectors in the semantic space. (Visualization tools and graphical navigation utilities in this space may appear useful). The aff
inity factors of both items and users to these \ldblquote semantic eigenvectors\rdblquote  may provide compact and meaningful representations of their essential features and assure more efficient communication of their meaning. Such \ldblquote 
semantic encoding\rdblquote  of information about ent
ities represented in the system may allow both dramatic improvements in information flows and significant reduction in bandwidth  requirements. The representations can range from simple aggregate value assessments to arbitrarily complex structured descrip
tions of people, objects, and their relations. The exchange and usage of this high-level information may be regulated by \ldblquote semantic communication protocols\rdblquote .  Possible uses of this technology are virtually unlimited. Terms such as 
\ldblquote Filtering systems\rdblquote , \ldblquote Recommender systems\rdblquote , and \ldblquote Semantic transport\rdblquote  describe just some of the particular applications in the large emerging field of distributed knowledge processing.}{

t ever undertaken in human history, with the greatest impact on social structures and with numerous technological challenges and social controversies on all levels.  As we know from experience with economic and political structures, it is extremely import
ant to build a proper architectural foundation that would assure efficiency and stability of an emerging social mechanism.
