  I can think of two ways to answer this question.

  The first is: if we think _who_ brings purpose into usage of otherwise
passive knowledge tools - and that can be only ourselves - then we'd agree
that even if we aim at "discovering objective truths", it is only because
we state it as a human purpose.

   The other is to look where the process is going. Modeling and
interpretation of the environment originated long before there appeared
humans or conscious formulation of purpose, and will continue long after
both humans and all their concepts lose any relevance to universal processes
of functional evolution. On one hand, humans and their aims are a small
temporary part of the process, with very limited understanding of it; on
the other, they are a part of objective reality that is building itself,
and models of itself. Building is "technology"; studying is "science";
science is also *building* of models (= part of technology).
  I would also subdivide science into studies of unintentionally constructed
things ("nature") and studies of intentionally constructed things. The first
are limited and increasingly well-known, the latter seem potentially a lot
richer.  So it seems plausible that eventually virtually all scientific
effort will be directed at studies of intentionally designed artifacts,
which will squeeze the remnants of relevance out of the above question...
