>Drifting Identities. </font></P>

<hr>

<P><font  >I always
wondered how far I can evolve without stopping being myself... It
seems possible that the identity issue can be the ultimate limit
to growth. </font></P>

<P><font  >First of all,
I think there is no such thing as an objective identity. So let
us consider a pair of an object (whose identity we are
discussing), and an observer/evaluator.</font></P>

<P><font  >Let's throw
some math at it: assume that our object is represented by a point
O evolving along a path P in a phase space S. </font></P>

<P><font  >The Evaluator
E is a function that projects S into an &quot;identity
space&quot; I. Usually E assigns the same value to all points of
a whole big area of S - a set of objects with &quot;the same
identity&quot;. So E[valuator] is essentially a map on a phase
space. </font></P>

<P><font  >Usually, at
least when talking about conscious entities, we require that the
objects with the same &quot;identity&quot; should not only be in
the same domain, but lie on the same path. This is a simple
axiom, we can accept it or not. It sounds somewhat artificial to
me though. If one can evolve from O1 to O2 without losing my
identity, why just not agree that O1=O2 as far as identity is
concerned? Otherwise, we should consider 'virtual identities'
which we can realize by actually going there. </font></P>

<P><font >OK, this is a
foundation. No matter how small and shaky it looks, it can
support the argument it was built for: </font></P>

<P><font  >Growth vs.
identity dilemma.</font></P>

<P><font  >I don't
really care what other Evaluators think about whether and when I
am going to cross an identity border on my evolutionary path.
Some of the evaluators seem to be of interest though: those that
are attached to the objects populating my current identity domain
(i.e. those into which I can possibly evolve without losing my
identity as I understand it in my current state). I would pay
special attention to the part of this domain consisting of
potentially reachable states.</font></P>

<P><font  >Now I want to
choose my path through this thing. </font></P>

<P><font  >There's very
little chance that I'll walk about it forever. (It is possible
though that this border lies beyond my current concept horizon,
which means that (subjectively and temporarily) I can enjoy the
feeling of &quot;eternal identity&quot;).</font></P>

<P><font  >Sooner or
later, though, my path will cross the border. </font></P>

<P><font  >We can call
this point just a loss of identity, or a personal singularity, or
death.</font></P>

<P><font  >Do I want to
go to this point? It depends of whether I like my domain. If I do
not, I might. </font></P>

<P><font  >Here we could
also note that death in this sense does not necessarily mean
desintegration, it may well be expansion beyond recognition,
which, without much logical reason, I perceive as a more
appealing choice. In fact, though, they are not that easy to
distinguish, since all my evaluation criteria fade near that
border.</font></P>

<P><font  >Now I move
along my path to the border, and look at it.</font></P>

<P><font  >My perception
of my identity domain can change, and the crossing point may
move. </font></P>

<P><font  >It the
simplest case, it doesn't. That's how most humans perceive
natural death. </font></P>

<P><font  >Sometimes it
can move towards me (I can't think of good examples now). </font></P>

<P><font  >In case of
expansion it looks like it will always move away, and
*subjectively* I will never cross the border.</font></P>

<P><font  >It raises
some interesting issues though. What if I know that if I choose
this path, I will soon come to a point D which currently looks
like the most miserable and disgusting outcome of my life, with a
full loss of identity. However, if I go and don't look too far
ahead, I'd always be happy with my state and immediate prospects,
until the very point D - and beyond. </font></P>

<P><font  >Should I
choose the destination that I currently respect, or the path that
will be enjoyable? Not an easy choice keeping in mind that upon
coming to that nice destination I might change enough to meet it
with disgust, and the entity that would enjoy the other path just
won't be me... </font></P>

<P><font  >I would
expect that all we all (not humans, extropians) will face some
tough choices here as soon as we learn how to grow.</font></P>

<P><font  >There is also
an explanation why we don't see people &quot;dying thru
expansion&quot;. And this is just because we *define* our notion
of identity as something that is preserved in the transformations
we are used to seeing. When (not if) the transformations will
become more drastic, this notion will be shattered. </font></P>

<P><font  >In fact, if
we just look at our own lives, we go through so many transitions
that hardly preserve our identity in any reasonable definition of
this word... </font></P>

<P><font  >Now I am
ending the message being attracted by a personal singularity
point that I try to cross daily and that is only an example of a
rich variety of identities that constitute something that I [?]
call &quot;myself&quot;. It's 2 a.m., time to sleep. I am
discontinuing my conscious existence, and leaving this message
together with all my belongings to the tomorrow's being who I
have never seen and who will probably think that he is *me*.</font></P>
