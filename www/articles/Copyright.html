I wrote my essays so that people could read them.
I would not mind to get reimbursed for my work, so that I can devote more
time and effort doing it, but I would never put any commercial considerations
in the way of the distribution of my ideas.
<P>
So the copyright statement here is not too restrictive:
Do not sell my work, keep it intact and mention me if you send it
to somebody, etc.
Also, I would request that you notify to me if you want to distribute
my articles to a large number of people, translate them or do anything
else significant.
<P>You are welcome to create Web links to any of my essays. I would
recommend that you link directly to my site, and do not copy the texts to
your directories (unless you really have to).  The reason here is that
I keep updating my texts, and your copy may quickly become out-of-date.
