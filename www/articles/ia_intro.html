<h1><font color="#ff0000"><li> Introduction</font></h1>
<p>
<p>
<br>This presentation intends to structure and organize the
broad and vaguely defined field of <em>Intelligence Augmentation</em>.
All the information that we will present today is the result of
such an effort. If there is no unique answer to most of our
problems, specially in this case there is not single classification
of this area. Being aware of all the parts and references
that are still missing in this work as well as the different
classifications and interpretations that one could find,
all your <a href="mailto:nuria@media.mit.edu">

are more than welcome! Thank you very much in advance.

<p><h1><font color="#ff0000"><li> Our definition of AI </font></h1>
<dd>
<dt>A field of study concerned with the development and use
of computer systems that have some
resemblance to human intelligence,
including such operations as natural-language recognition and
use, problem solving, selection from alternatives,
pattern recognition, generalization based on
experience, and analysis of novel situations.
(From <A HREF="http://www.apnet.com/www/ap/index.htm">Academic Press Dictionary of Science Technology</A>)
<p>
<dt>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that studies
intelligent behavior in humans using the tools-theoretical
and experimental-of computer
science. The field simultaneously addresses one of the most
profound scientific problems-the nature of intelligence-and engages in
pragmatically useful undertakings: developing intelligent systems.
The concepts, techniques, and technology of AI offer us a number of ways
to discover what intelligence is-what one must know to be smart at
 a particular task-and a variety of computational techniques for
embedding that intelligence in a program.

<p><h1><font color="#ff0000"><li> Our definition of IA </font></h1>
<dd>
<dt>IA is the discipline or set of disciplines
devoted to technologically expand our physical or/and
cognitive abilities
beyond the range of natural humans. [David Brin, The Postman]
<p>
<dt>A way of increasing the capability of a man to approach a
complex problem situation, to gain comprehension
to suit his particular needs, and to derive
solutions to problems.
Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the
following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension,
the possibility of gaining a useful
degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex,
speedier solutions, better
solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions
to problems that before seemed insoluble.

<h1><font color="#ff0000"><li> Goals</font></h1>
<p>
<br>
<h2>1. AI</h2>
Develop intelligent computers that emulate intelligent behavior in humans.
Intelligent behavior can be characterized by these abilities to:
<ol>
<li>Respond to situations very flexibly,
<li>make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages,
<li>recognize the relative importance of
different elements of a situation,
<li>find similarities between situations despite differences which
may separate them, or
<li>to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link
them
</ol>
<br>
The field of artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a variety of
activities serving several interrelated scientific and practical aims:

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the psychology and behavior of people, animals,
      and artificial agents,
  <li>Making intelligent machines, whether these work the same way
      people do or not, and
  <li>Formalizing and mechanizing human knowledge, both common sense
      and expertise, in all areas of human endeavor.
  <li>Making working with computers as easy and as helpful as working
      with skilled, cooperative, and possibly expert people.
  <li>Solve intellectual problems both theoretical and practical,
      common and esoteric;
  <li>Control robot motions through planning, sight, and touch;
  <li>Interpret human language, both written and spoken; and
  <li>Learn new skills and knowledge from experience and other data.
</ul>

<h1><font color="#ff0000"><p><li> HISTORY OF IA </font></h1>


Utilization of external technological tools played the crucial role
on all stages of human evolution. From simple tools (physical extensions)
to domesticated animals for watching the environment and transportation,
and clay tablets and books (external memory),
people have been increasingly dependent on external artifacts for
enhancements of their physical functions as well as perception and
intellectual abilities.
<P>
In recent history, the tools have become more complex and autonomous,
performing increasingly sophisticated and abstract functions, and
development of extensions to human intelligence has been transformed
into a rapidly growing area of both theoretical research and practical
system development.


<P>
<STRONG>Some recent landmarks in this process include:</STRONG>
<p>
<br>
<b>1945 </b><br><ul>
<li>Vannevar Bush describes the "memex" in Atlantic magazine.
</ul>
<br>
<b>1958</b><br><ul>
<li>Good (17)
includes some conjecture about possibilities of intellectual aid
to the human by close cooperation
with a computer in a rather general way,
and also presents a few interesting thoughts about a
network model for structuring the conceptual kernels of
information to facilitate a sort of
self-organizing retrieval system.
(Good, I. J., "How Much Science Can You Have at Your Fingertips?"
IBM Journal of
Research and Development, Vol. 2, No. 4 (October 1958) )
</ul>
<br>
<b>1960</b><br><ul>
<li> Licklider publishes article titled "Man-Computer Symbiosis"
to refer to the close interaction relationship between the man
and the computer in mutually beneficial cooperation. He predicted
that "in not too many years, human brains and computing machines
will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting
partnership will think as no human being has ever thought and
process data in a way not approached by the information-handling
machines we know today". He
proposes human-computer interactions to expand thought and data
processing at the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) of the
U.S.
Department of Defense (which eventually develops word processing,
personal computing, desktop publishing, and spreadsheets, and
establishes
ARPAnet, the beginning of the Internet)
<li>Ulam specifically
recommendeds close man-computer interaction in a chapter entitled,
"synergesis," where he points
out in considerable detail the types of mathematical
work which could be aided (Ulam, S. M., A Collection of Mathematical Problems, p. 135 (Interscience Publishers, Inc.,New York, N.Y., 1960)).
<li>Fein makes a comprehensive projection of the growth and
dynamic inter-relatedness of "computer-related
sciences," includes specific mention of the enhancement of
human intellect by cooperative activity
of men, mechanisms, and automata.
He coins the term "synnoetics" as applicable generally to the
cooperative interaction of people, mechanisms, plant or animal organisms,
and automata into a
system whose mental power is greater than that of its components,
and presents a good picture of
the integrated way in which many separate disciplines
should be developed and taught in
the future to do justice to their mutual roles in the
important metadiscipline defined as
"synnoetics."
(Fein, Louis, "The Computer-Related Science (Synnoetics)
at a University in the Year 1975,"
unpublished paper (December 1960)).
</ul>
<br>
<b>1961</b><br><ul>
<li> Ramo gives a number of talks and writes
some articles dealing with the future
possibilities of computers for "extending man's intellect".
His
projections are slanted more toward larger bodies of humans
interacting with computers, in less
of an intimate personal sense.
(Ramo, Simon, "The Scientific Extension of the Human Intellect,"
Computers and Automation (February 1961)).
</ul>
<br>
<b>1963 </b><br><ul>
<li>Douglas C. Engelbart establishes the Augmentation Research
Center at
the Stanford Research Institute and publishes "A Conceptual
Framework for
the Augmentation of Man's Intellect".</ul>
<br>
<b>1970 </b><br><ul>
<li>Alan Kay publishes The Art of Human-Computer Interaction.</ul>
<br>
<b>1977</b><br><ul>
<li>Ted Nelson publishes The Home Computer Revolution .</ul>
<br>
<b>1985</b><br><ul>
<li>Howard Rheingold publishes Tools for Thought (Simon and
Schuster).</ul>
<br>
In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of both practical
and theoretical work on the subject. This has also been a decade when
practical
usage of IA technology spread to the homes of practically all educated
people, and millions of people became interested in the cutting edge
and promises of advanced intelligence augmentation tools.
This includes fast computers with graphical interfaces, microprocessors
in many household appliances, massive computerization of workplaces,
global communication networks including Internet, universal acceptance
of email, pagers, cellular phones, teleconferencing and other tools
of electronic communications, digital signal processing,
personal assistants, explosive growth of
the Web, proliferation of cryptography, tools for manipulating
graphics, sounds and video streams, electronics security systems, etc.
<P>
More advanced areas of research and development include interactive
3-D modeling, extensive studies in ergonomics, speech recognition,
Virtual and Enhanced Reality, automated translation, Software agents
technologies,
Neural Networks, Alife and genetic programming, industrial robotics,
digital cash, telepresence, nanotechnology, etc.


<h1><font color="#ff0000"><P><li> DOMAINS OF IA</font></h1>
<ol>
<h3><li>Artifacts</h3>
Physical objects designed to provide for human comfort, for the
manipulation of things or materials, and for the manipulation of symbols.

<h3><li>Language</h3>
The way in which the individual parcels out the picture of his world into the
concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he
attaches to those concepts and uses in consciously manipulating
the concepts ("thinking").

<h3><li>Methodology</h3>
The methods, procedures, strategies, etc., with which an individual organizes
his goal-centered (problem-solving) activity.

<h3><li>Training</h3>
The conditioning needed by the human being to bring his skills
in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are
operationally effective.

The cameras are coming.
They're getting smaller and nothing will stop them. The
only question is: Who watches

sophisticated surveillance
technology is going to filter
down to the private sector, and
the government will have the
ability to keep an eye on all of
us. The pull seems to be in
favor of accountability at the
cost of personal privacy. It
sounds like an Orwellian
nightmare, but it could be a
vital step in protecting our
liberty.

<h2><li>Creativity</h2>

The computer savants correctly notice that
computerization alters relationships of social power and control;
however, the most obvious beneficiaries of this change are large
transnational business corporations. While
their "global reach" does not arise solely from
the application of information technologies, such organizations
are uniquely situated to exploit the new electronic possibilities
for greater efficiency, productivity, command,
and control. Other notable beneficiaries will be public
bureaucracies, intelligence agencies, and ever-expanding
military organizations.
<p>
Ordinary people are, of course, strongly
affected by these organizations and by the rapid spread of new
electronic systems in banking, insurance, taxation, work,
home entertainment, and the like. They are counted on
to be eventual eager buyers of hardware, software, and
communications services.
<p>
But where is any motion toward increased democratization and
social equality, or the dawn of a cultural
renaissance? Current empirical studies of computers and social
change - such as those described in Computers
and Politics by James Danzig - suggest an increase
in power by those who already have a great deal of power,
an enhanced centralization of control by those already in control,
and an augmentation of wealth by the already
wealthy. If there is to be a computer revolution,
it will most likely have a distinctly conservative character.
<p>
With Intelligence Augmentation, the risk of an even
more polarized society, a world dominated by the few privileged who
had been augmented and therefore enjoy of much more
powerful tools dramatically increases.
Will IA be a privilege or a right?
It is a challenge
-our challenge- to
ensure a democratic augmentation of society.
Who will decide
whom to augment? How? When? Where?
