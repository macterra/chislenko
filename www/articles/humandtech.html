<strong>A complete history of humans and technology </strong></font></P>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font  >I
started typing a reply to the extropian list thread on &quot;too
many choices&quot;, and came up with the following notes on
evolution of humans and technology that are actually getting
close to what I really think is happening with humans. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >I
hope you will like these ideas and help me develop them.</font></P>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font  >Let
us look at things from a systemic perspective and define our
subject as an organism consisting of a core control system and a
bunch of sensors and actuators on the periphery. If the organism
is small and simple, its parts may be mixed together and perform
the same simple functions all the time. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >In
further growth we have more and more functional elements and an
increasingly complex architecture. The development of further
functions within the same structure becomes difficult; I can list
the following reasons for it: </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >-
new additions become increasingly specialized and geared towards
specific and rare situations. So they offer diminishing benefits,
while body maintenance costs grow at least linearly. After a
while, new additions to the same body are just not worth it. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >-
in a random mutation/selection scheme, the more complex the body,
the less selective influence you get from each of the features. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >So
with time it makes sense to turn to a dynamic system
configuration. The connected core body retains generic control
functions which allow it to incorporate, permanently of
temporarily, specialized attachments (a.k.a. tools, accessories,
and instruments) - from problem-solving techniques to
screwdrivers. The open control system has to be more general and
structured, as it has no opportunity to grow together with the
tools, but is instead used to acquire, configure and manage the
toolkits and exchange them with the environment. - This is my
understanding of the role of intelligence. It is still
considerably simpler than the old integrated part of the
organism, whose controls are pre-calibrated for use with its
permanent instruments. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >This
scheme allows for rapid evolution of exosomatic attachments
(knowledge and technological artifacts). This shared toolkit soon
outgrows the manipulational abilities of the personal generic
intelligence, and puts it under stress - &quot;too much
choice/complexity&quot;. Though still much simpler than the old
part of the organism, the intelligence hurts more because it is
stretched more and, since it's the intelligence that voices its
opinion, it in understandable selfishness pays more attention to
its own problems.</font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >The
overload problem is solved by &quot;emigration&quot; of
organisms' functionality. First available method is to elevate
some integrational features of an organism to meta-personal
level. Thus, a loose collection of individuals
(&quot;population&quot;) turns into an integrated social
structure, and the individual organisms are forced to turn into
semi-specialized tools by integrating with particular instruments
(&quot;profession&quot;). Still, even with a growing size of the
social organism and improving ways of instrument exchange, this
process is limited by the same personal abilities and population
size. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >The
second method is to delegate some generic features to the tools
themselves and make sure they have a greater degree of autonomy
(easy-to-use; reliable; versatile) and can, in turn, combine with
each other and accept additional features. We may expect that
they would do it faster and easier than humans. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >It
is quite natural that the first information functions to migrate
to the external tools are abstract and precise operations, as
they are both most needed for an open intelligent system, and
least efficiently implemented in biological minds - actually,
symbolic manipulation abilities are just the latest and rather
clumsy and slow patch on the ancient brain architecture whose
main strengths are signal processing and image recognition. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >Then
the tools start taking over these areas as well... </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >One
of the very recent phenomena is that the external tools are
starting to get better in communication than the human symbolic
abilities. Written language is a wonderful and information-rich
form of knowledge representation. Unfortunately, the human brain
processes much slower than the physical signals. One of the
important reasons for proliferation of symbolic communication
until recently was inefficiency of external information storage
and transmission media that could not handle more than letters
and digits. With the inventions of radio, telephone, movies, and
GUI interfaces humans return to processing what they handle well
- physical images. This doesn't mean decline of symbolic
information processing - on the contrary, it is exploding and
taking over analog processing. This process, however, is going on
in the media that handle symbols well - and this doesn't include
the brain. So the new media are bypassing the human symbolic I/O
and taking it upon themselves. (This process is somewhat similar
to what happened with digestion and cooking - cooking performs
some of the functions of breaking up proteins so much better than
the digestive system, that with some kinds of food we totally
rely upon it. I would not be surprised if most humans have
already lost the ability to effectively digest raw meat.)</font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >The
complexity of human life will probably start dropping sometime
soon together with human utility for the system.</font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >Actually,
a naked human body (i.e. unsupplemented with externally developed
knowledge or material tools) already has no utility - or rather,
*would* not have, as I do not believe there is a single human
body in that state today.</font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >A
growing number of humans is finding themselves of little utility
even as tool operators, no matter how hard they try; as humans
are losing comparative advantages over distributed and
non-biological systems, the shrinking number of them are needed -
usually those with particularly strong or unique skills. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >What
will happen to humans as the result of this process may be
unclear; However, I would expect that the human share of *input*
into the growing network of material artifacts and knowledge will
dramatically diminish over the next generation or two, with most
people falling out of the process. </font></P>

<p align="left"><font  >Actually,
tragic as it sounds to me, most humans probably won't care, as
they have already no sense of, and no interest in understanding,
the development of the global process. (Or did they ever?) </font></P>
