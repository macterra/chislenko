there exist common system laws governing the development of
various complex objects, ranging from animals and plants to
sciences and economies, regardless of details of their
implementation in different contexts, and try to foresee future

INTRODUCTORY NOTE</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">In full
accordance with written here, I believe that no article can
represent an ultimate value, but is always only a part of the
growing organism of scientific knowledge that works partly
through us, writers and readers; and it is this entity, not us or
articles, that is slowly shaping itself towards the Absolute
Truth. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">So we (I and
this article) are trying to unselfishly take part in this
process, deliberately leaving some gaps in presentation and too
categorical, questionable or unexplained statements, with the aim
to provoke further discussion rather than to try prematurely
polish our own look. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">I have made
no efforts to make this text an easy reading, like explaining
that one thousand million is a billion, or noting that calling
self-replication a necessary feature of all life forms would be
insulting for lonely, sick and elderly people. However, the
presentation is arranged so that the reader can get used to the
ideas. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>3
STARTING POINT</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">The behavior
of any object depends solely on its structure, i.e. the number of
its elements and the character of their links. This means that if
we have two objects with equivalent structures, and the only
difference between them is in implementation and naming of their
parts and links, then the behavior of these two objects will be
exactly the same (except, possibly, the means of its expression).
</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">It is
therefore reasonable to speak of classes of objects with
equivalent structures; let us call them 'systems'. </font></p>

FEATURES OF SYSTEM STRUCTURES </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Human minds
seem to be better suited for spotting differences between things
than for finding commonalities (it is not by chance that some
languages have words like 'pine' and 'birch', but not 'tree').
This may be the main reason of why so little attention is paid to
some striking similarities between many natural and artificial
systems. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">This table
briefly illustrates some common features and stages of
development of systems in the following three spheres: </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">(*) in the
sense of not consisting of parts of the same system level </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Some
additional features are: backup subsystems, spare parts and
capacities, competition of subsystems for resources and attention
of higher levels, conflicts over control, aging problems etc.,
etc...; even the [geometrical average] number of parts in all
systems appears to be the same. These commonalities go far beyond
basic cybernetical observations of information processing; in
fact, one may reasonably suppose that there exist common system
laws governing development of morphic entities regardless of the
details of their implementation in different contexts. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">All of the
above listed features appear approximately at the same levels of
development of each system; it seems that given the first two
columns of the above table and the [well-known] speed of progress
in computer systems, we would have been able as long ago as 1950
to predict (and prepare for) the time of arrival of computer
networks and viruses - instead of dreaming of big lonely
MULTIVACs. Totalitarianists could also keep in mind that their
beloved centrally-regulated monolithic societies, just like
unicellular organisms and consecutive stand-alone computers, are
competitive only as long as they (and their environments) are
unsophisticated - and could think (or, rather, could have
thought) of how to keep them that way. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">But it is of
course easy to predict the past. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>5
CLASSES OF SYSTEMS </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">It seems
possible to divide systems into general classes, like colony,
organism and biocenosis (ecology), judging by their essential
features, most important of which seem to be complexity,
interconnectedness, clusterization, strength of feedbacks, etc.
If a certain system structurally falls into a given class, say,
'organism', then IT IS AN ORGANISM, since God/Nature perceive(s)
and guide(s) it as such, while we can call it a rabbit, piece of
software, national economy, language, culture or science. The
difference between a structurally equivalent computer program and
a body (or a culture and an intelligent consciousness) is no more
than in our perception. We think we 'see' 'real' living organisms
and, hence, they 'exist', while other systems are just 'imaginary
entities' (though we never see the structures, but only external
properties, like skin color, spatial position etc., and all
important features have to mentally derive, anyway). </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">We can look
around and see that our planet is abundant with all kinds of
developing life and intelligence, and for much of it we serve as
(still, unfortunately, unconscious) carriers or elementary
substrata. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">All our
subsystems and supersystems live their own lives and have little
(though gradually growing) interest and knowledge of each other. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">We have
little understanding of how our own cells or the parts of
consciousness work, and no single individual is likely to ever
have much more, since the complexity of these systems by far
exceeds the capacities of the consciously controlled part of the
human brain. But there are other entities, namely, the sciences
of citology and psychology, that, once brought to life, continue
working as our agents of communication with our own parts,
studying and testing them in their own planned and orderly
manner, and often pursuing goals that represent their own logic
of development rather than the individual understanding of
practical value by any single human being.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>6 OUR
PERCEPTION OF OTHER LIVING SYSTEMS </strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">6.1
    Familiar Entities We accept other systems as living if they
    look just like us, especially if they have the same
    appearance, age, language and skin color. (This is why much
    more attention is paid to unborn or mentally retarded
    representatives of Homo Sapiens than to much more conscious
    healthy adults of other species). </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">6.2 Alien
    Entities We have special names (just like 'birch' and 'pine')
    for those systems [we think] we understand and use special
    methods for each type without trying to generalize or
    recognizing equal rights for all living entities. Usually we
    take it for granted that cells, cultures, subconscious parts
    of our minds, etc., work, but do not care whether and how
    they feel. The Green movement is now broadening its ethical
    view, starting to think of the rights of insects, bacteria
    and baking yeast. But there are some things they do ignore:
    namely, that such entities as philosophy or the Green
    movement itself are more alive than the baking yeast, in any
    reasonable sense of the word; that bed-bugs, cockroaches,
    mafia and urban life-style are also very natural formations,
    and still the first three of them (or all four, by some
    opinions) are well worth destroying; that life is a permanent
    interaction among all living beings, and some of them do,
    unfortunately, have to lose (I am far from saying they may be
    thoughtlessly destroyed). </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">It seems
    that the process we see unfolding around us is not a
    destruction of nature by 'non-nature', but a gigantic leap in
    natural evolution, with an explosive number of new cultural,
    scientific and technological species pushing some old species
    (like, alas, spotted owl, and, hopefully, bed-bugs) out of
    the niches of their original existence, and we have the
    greatest historical opportunity to observe this process, take
    part in guiding it - and reap incredible benefits for
    ourselves. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">6.3
    Complex Systems If a thing is complex enough, and its
    analysis seems to be of little practical value, people prefer
    to perceive/admire/worship it as a 'whole', often hating the
    very idea of 'disassembling' the sacred object. Music and
    arts are good examples of this situation. Though there is no
    such thing as an undifferentiated whole (with, possibly, a
    few elementary exceptions), and those nice objects would be
    much better off if there were a place in their admirers'
    minds for both their beauty and design.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">6.4
    Supersystems If a system is incredibly complex and its ways
    cannot be understood to any reasonable degree, its influence
    can be sensed only by certain events that tend to occur when
    we follow some vaguely understood rules. In this case, it is
    easier to simply 'obey' those rules, i.e. to do things
    expected to bring positive feedbacks, or just try to pray to
    the supersystem in one's own language and wait until it hears
    and helps. This is certainly very similar to what we think of
    God. Let us also look at it from another point of view and
    imagine what our cells might think about the systems they are
    parts of. All of them could agree that a system consisting of
    themselves (and hence not a material object, but, like a
    society for us, just a structure they support, a way they do
    things together) cannot think, feel or plan anything by
    itself. &quot;It may look structurally like it is alive, but
    it is us who do it all&quot;, they might say of us - as
    people say of grander systems. Most of the cells are unable
    to collect any information about their environment beyond
    what is needed for performing their simple physical duties.
    They keep doing their jobs, exhausting available resources,
    assuming that before the resources are over, some smarter
    neighbors or higher powers will take care of the problem.
    Those with higher abilities (but still in no way capable of
    comprehending the Great Whole - e.g., a hair root they live
    in) take part in 'social' development and may choose between
    improving their environment themselves and sending complaints
    to some higher 'divine' authority. The results of the first
    approach are guaranteed but limited by the cell's model of
    the environment and abilities; the second approach is not
    always successful, since the gods are not quite almighty and
    tend to leave the complaints misunderstood or unnoticed - but
    if the complaints are loud enough and/or supported by
    neighbors, they may be gracefully acknowledged. In our
    example, some substances are sent in by local gods(=organs),
    or the person whose head carries the hair, scratches or
    washes it, or - an extremely rare case! - there can be a
    direct interference from some super-authority, like killing
    of this particular rioting cell by a well-focused X-ray beam,
    to stop the trouble. It is hardly possible to give a general
    advice of what can be asked by a part from a whole, but it is
    possible to note how. By utilizing the part's links with the
    system; silent prayers are never heard, though they may
    unintentionally alter the internal state of the subsystem and
    bring desirable - or some other - results. They may also
    employ some hidden information channels, like 'talking' to
    other layers of one's own consciousness or transmitting weak
    radio messages. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>7
EVOLUTION OF A SUPERSYSTEM </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">At the very
beginning, parts voluntary form some joint structure, following
their own logic of development. This is already a birth of a
supersystem, though it is still weak and vitally dependent on its
creators; its life seems to be in the hands of a few of them.
Then, after some time, it grows to become their more or less
equal partner, with its own needs and logic, but still
understandable by the conventional wisdom of the parts - if they
choose to study and respect the laws of the new formation they
found themselves in. At this stage, they may choose to occupy one
or another niche in the system. They are still more or less free,
counting personal balances of participation in different kinds of
activities - a market phase of development. At further stages,
with new strengths and runaway complexity, the new superorganism
develops its own ideas of progress. Its creators lose track of
its development, but go on taking part in it, since now they are
supported by the system for their loyalty - and punished for lack
of it. An integrated system can seldom abandon its parts, even if
they are inefficient; rather it provides them with additional
resources and attention. So the competition for resources and
records of local accounts lose their leading roles to more
complex and distributed decision-making schemes. Meanwhile, parts
see their safety and wealth rapidly increase at the expense of
their freedom, until none of them is able to abandon the system
and live 'in the wild'. This is what happened to our cells. This
tends to happen in totalitarian societies, with their
overdeveloped social structures (or just well developed, from
their own point of view), in well-integrated corporations, in
software packages, in happy families and is gradually happening
in advanced economies. &quot;The Futurist&quot; once discussed a
possibility that technology can turn humans into cyborgs -
creatures, 'consisting by more than a half of artificial parts'.
I would define a cyborg nation as one with more than half of its
individuals artificially kept alive. Technology has really made
us healthier and better off - within the economic system, but how
many of us would survive if all of it suddenly disappeared?
Hardly half would be left. And not only because we are
unprepared; there are simply too many of us, and it is likely
that more than 95% of us would rapidly die out in
&quot;natural&quot; (?!) conditions - and this percentage has
been increasing throughout all of the human history - with an
obvious upper limit. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>8 OUR
ATTITUDE TO SUPERSYSTEMS </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">The prefix
'super' in this context means no more than a shorthand for
'upper-level' and reflects our view on the system from inside,
rather than from outside. So, 'super' means just a metaphenomenon
and shouldn't be confused with 'superior'. In fact, the
upper-level structure of a system can be much simpler than the
internal structures of many of its parts. Hence, we should not be
shocked that the systems we are in - like a scientific community,
United Nations or Gaia - are, at the first stages of their
development, inefficient and often waste the precious resources
they are going to badly lack in their near future. We may learn
what it feels to live within a primitive beast - or, rather, a
child. Children are often inexperienced, clumsy and short-sighted
- but they grow, especially when properly taught. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>9
NETWORKS AND ECOLOGIES</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">The now
popular word 'network' doesn't describe a special type of
systems, but just means a multiplicity of relatively stable ties
between neighbor elements, i.e. the 'local complexity' of the
system, and hints at presence of multiple feedbacks - a feature
also present in many other types of structures. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">There were
free-trade networks of merchandize flow between tribes and
city-states in ancient times; later they were replaced by
non-network, but much more complex and efficient systems of
international trade, though we can still find their remnants in
grey-market structures. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">There also
are highly deterministic governmental, computer, or sewage
networks that demonstrate predictable responses for known inputs
and are different from plain tree-like hierarchies in complexity,
but not in nature. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">And there are
flexible ecological networks based on cooperation and commitment
(though quite not free from conflicts), and instinctive, if not
conscious, feeling of common destiny. But networking is not the
most important word here; a scientific community corresponding
through one central computer is much easier to call an ecology
than, say, a complex early-warning defense network. The real
difference here lies in the nature of the links rather than in
their number. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Among
different system types, biocenotic (ecological) systems seem
superior in many respects: they combine greater freedom of parts
with overall complexity, flexibility and stable performance
within very wide limits of tolerance. But all planning in an
ecology is local and is performed by non-ecological participating
entities. And the human mind seems to resist the very idea of

CONSEQUENCES OF THE LIVING SYSTEMS VIEW </strong></font></p>

can really look at many things as living entities; but what
difference does it make? </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">First, it
attempts to present a common basis for holistic and rational
paradigms; it might be called 'demystified holism'. Second, it
seems to be a platform for building a kind of transhuman ethics.
Third, we can try to formulate some generic methods for
contacting other living - and thinking - entities. </font></p>

SCENARIO FOR FURTHER SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Most existing
objects employ a combination of various structure types for
performing different functions. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
build the classification of structures on the analysis of system
functions, rather than objects themselves.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Let us try to
assess future social roles of these three types of functions: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">-
    traditional life-support, such as local trade and services,
    is likely to be provided by good old market forces well into
    foreseeable future, and institutional and technological
    influence is not likely to translate into any drastic
    structural change in this sphere. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">-
    regulatory functions will be carried out by the developing
    network of institutional hierarchies - with some structural
    changes, especially on the global level; here we should
    beware of cancer-like growth of simple centralized
    structures, despite of anti-totalitarian shots timely made by
    History into some parts of the developing global social
    organism (I mean painful socialist experiments in the East)
    to make the rest of it more resistant to evilly attractive
    ideas of centralization. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">-
    structural social and technological changes - the essence of
    the coming age - will be provided by more and more
    biocenosis-like systems; hence, we can expect corresponding
    changes in phase portraits, such as economic cycles. The
    innovations have never appeared in the society by means of
    free exchange or direct orders, that can only take care of
    allocation of necessary resources and spreading the novelty.
    With innovations becoming the core of the social life we will
    see increasing role of non-market and non-governmental groups
    with common interests and knowledge in various special areas.
    We can also expect that economic (= monocriterial)
    considerations will continue losing their indicative and
    guiding roles. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">In the
evolution of any system, new parts appear to better reflect
existing (and planned) functions; ideally, the system's structure
should reflect its functions; we can observe that functions are
getting incorporated into new structural entities: separation of
flowers from leaves; arts, advertisement and money from material
production; information from its carriers, etc. This transition
becomes possible after new features become ripe enough to be
acknowledged, or the old ones grow complex enough to require
further structurization, or there appear breakthroughs in the
speed and ease of internal communications system.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">In the
socio-economic sphere it means that while the walls between
functionally homogeneous entities, until recently represented by
high costs of material and information interchange, continue to
crumble, thus altering the effective metrics of the social space,
we will see more and more institutions based on similarity of
interests of their members rather then on their spacial
proximity, with the old-fashioned organizations based on
territorial sovereignty rights (state and local governments)
rapidly losing their roles. Among other things, it means that the
readers with investments into local media might win from moving
them into special interest editions. </font></p>

    we teach other systems: by training and testing them; just as
    we do with children, with our own cells and organs (morning
    exercises), with parts of our minds (lessons and tests), with

    them relatively small but structurally important tasks. All
    these spheres can share their experience. </font></p>

FINAL NOTE </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Let us try to
guess what other complex entities could do when they at last
develop some real intelligence and attempt to openly contact us,
humans. A good idea would be to start with a message carrying a
manifest of their conscious life. The only way of making such a
message understandable to us would be to pass it through our
regular information channels, like mind patterns or this printed
article. And, as always, all of the agencies employed in carrying
this message - philosophy, language, society, the human author,
his neurons, word processor, U.S. Postal Service and others -
perceive it as belonging to them. The question is how many of
them are developed enough to do it consciously? While writing
this text, I had a queer sensation of someone guiding my hand.
Could it be one of them? Or someone else?.. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman Cyr"><strong>14
HABITATS FOR LIFE </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Each of us
has read something about possibilities of non-human intelligence
and 'even' non-carbon life; but I failed to find any interesting
ideas about general conditions necessary to support life. I would
close the problem of intelligence by saying that it is an
attribute common to all life-forms, with differences in features
and sophistication. We can also more or less easily define such
things as a reflective consciousness (as a feeling of a system of
itself, or storage of the information on the global state of the
system on a local level, etc.) and other attributes of
intelligence in general system terms.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">I wouldn't
like to argue here about the definition of life; there is a
number of them, and even a few general features that almost
everyone seems to agree on, sound very questionable. Thus, growth
and self-replication apply to crystals, rumors, puddles and
clouds, but not to elderly people... Instead, I would suggest a
view that 'life' is a certain stage of developmental processes,
and all processes inevitably come to (and pass) this stage
provided certain basic conditions are met. So let's try to
discuss these conditions, see what kind of environments can
provide them, and what changes in the conditions can lead to the
development of really (i.e. in essence, not implementation)
different forms of life and intelligence.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Definition of
terms. In mathematics, a space - whether topological, linear or
other - is just a set of points with a structure; here let's
think of a 'space' as the basic uniform structure of the
environment, and 'objects' or 'entities' as [epi]structures
'immersed' in this space. The readers with some understanding of
mathematics can derive stricter meaning themselves, and those
without it won't understand it anyway... </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Here are the
basic 'life conditions' - i.e. attributes of the environment that
ensure that the development will go far enough: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">1) Large
    enough living space - in terms of the number of elementary
    units. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">2)
    Ability of units/elements to interact </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">3)
    Relative stability of structures (links between elements) -
    so that new emerging entities could survive long enough to
    communicate to others and/or give life to new forms. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">4)
    Relative mobility of structures - to ensure that some change
    can occur. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">5) Long
    enough life time in terms of relative units of time </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">I do not
claim that this is a complete set of necessary and sufficient
conditions for life development (which doesn't mean it isn't),
and they are not even strictly defined here, but this is already
enough to present one more system table, and draw certain
conclusions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">The space
structure and interaction details have a strong influence on all
structures living in the given environment; let's just sketch
some differences that can arise in other environments: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">- if the
    space allows teleportation, we can expect to see bodies
    consisting of physically unconnected parts, more ethical
    societies (since otherwise they would be simply killed by the
    omnipresent and uncathable crime), impossibility of
    totalitarianism (which is strongly dependent on the ability
    of the government to keep the citizens from getting out of
    its control area), absence of cities and other big clusters
    of population (all places are equally close to each other),
    etc. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">We can also
note that all our bodies, social organizations, and even concept
structures reflect the structure of the space we live in;
research shows that the average number of parts in a whole in all
human classifications is very close to number pi, which seems to
reflect the relations of proximity of different parts of the
human brain, as well as individual neurons, living in the
Cartesian space. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Here it is
probably time to note that spaces in which many other structures
reside, are effectively non-Cartesian. For example, the computer
memory space is essentially a discrete set of points, and it
takes [approximately] the same amount of time to get from one
[memory] location to another. </font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">The success
of transportation and communication systems is based on their
changing the effective metrics of social space; originally
designed to shorten the distances between the [participants],
they often entirely change the structure of the space they
operate in; for example, effective structures of
telecommunications networks (with time and ease of access as
measures of distance) are essentially discrete, and not only our
regular notions of distance and dimensionality are irrelevant
here, but the whole telecommunications service industry operates
according to new laws: there are no local monopolies, at least
within a calling area, there is no need to put the communications
equipment on the cross-roads (or even keep it visible in the
physical world); the market niches are purely functional, without
territorial considerations; there is no such thing here as
differential rent; the number of competing services is different
from one in regular 3-D businesses, which affects the degree of
monopolization in the industry, decision-making processes,
business cycles, etc. One of the major reasons of transition from
decision-making based on participatory democracy to
representation schemes and multilevel bureaucracies is the
limitations of Cartesian space that do not allow sufficiently
large assemblies of citizens - namely, inability of two objects
to occupy a single space, and travel expenses - and these
limitations simply do not exist in many other spatial structures.</font></p>

<p><font color="#004080" face="Times New Roman Cyr">Most of our
concept structure is based on our 3-D notions of localities,
weights, shapes and appearances, and there seem to be few people
and concepts that ever leave the limitations of the Cartesian
space, or generalize enough to make any sense outside our
particular spacial implementation of functional structures. </font></p>
