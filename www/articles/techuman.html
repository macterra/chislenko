This essay was originally written as a blueprint for my speech at

as a continuation of my thoughts on technological augmentation of humans
and general functional evolution.  I am  still polishing it, and would

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H2>

People usually agree that we are living through a technological
<EM>revolution</EM>, yet they seem confused about what this means. By
definition, a revolution is a leap between two quasi-stationary stages. If
we want to understand the meaning of a revolution, we should identify the
current stage, the next stage, and the nature and purpose of the
transition.
<P>
There are many opinions about the meaning of technological progress.
Typical discussions of technological changes consist of surface
observations of current phenomena.  Usual discourse about transitions to
cyberspace and things electronic, digital, and democratic doesn't explore
where these transitions originate, how they fit into the grand-scale
evolutionary process, and what may happen next. This essay attempts to
classify current technologies in the context of general historical progess
of complex systems evolution, analyze history of relations of humans and
technology, and envision some long-term future trends.


<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Evolution of functional structures</H2>

There are different ways to look at what currently exists, what constitutes
an identity, and what is being augmented. We can examine the distributed
environment of functional patterns temporarily incorporated in bodies,
brains, machines, and social structures.

<P>
In this essay I will utilize the common model of the world as based on
physical elements of people, with their bodies, tools, and ideas. Today
there is much stronger integration of features within a physical body, so
physical entities are conscious, and understandably they want to talk to
each other about their own development. In the not-so-distant future
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/mindage.html">distributed entities may become more
conscious</A>, and then they will talk to each other in different terms.

<P>
We can view the world as an arena of systems evolution. To maintain
competitive efficiency, systems have to develop certain features, such as
complexity, integration, and [what I call] <STRONG>liquidity</STRONG>.
They also should be able to utilize the <A HREF="Cyborgs.html">legacy of
system structures</A> that were developed earlier and often for quite
different purposes.

<P>
Complexity and integration are useful for optimizing  current behavior;
liquidity allows transformations and growth. All three are means, not ends,
however. Nobody is interested in making things more complex or integrated
just for the fun of it.  Within any complexity limit, one can implement
only a limited number of functions, so competition provides the impetus for
systems to attempt more and more complex patterns.

<P>By liquidity, I mean two things. One, is <STRONG>independence of
structure from the physical substrate</STRONG>, facilitating more
replication and other functions. Structures  originally imbedded in the
substrate developed more independence. Things like pressure, waves, and
electric current, can already move across the substrate - so techniques of
<A HREF="http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/ch01c01.htm">
moving bits without moving atoms</A> are actually billions of years old.
Crystal structures can replicate more complex patterns within the same
material; living organisms pass features and behavioral patterns to
physically unconnected bodies; information technology allows structures to
travel between different substrates and change representations (which is
basically the same thing but one level of abstraction higher - it is
passing semantics between different syntactic substrates).

<P>
Replication represents only obe simple aspect of functional evolution. It
allows proliferation, but not qualitative growth. For growth, systems must
possess <STRONG>internal structural liquidity</STRONG>. Functional
structures should be able to modify themselves and combine with each other,
to optimize behavior, to adapt to changing conditions, and to occupy new
domains. This liquidity requires <STRONG>generalized layered architectures,
modular adaptable designs, common communication interfaces</STRONG>, etc.

<P>In a search for compromise between complexity, integration, and
liquidity, the evolutionary process invented a system of organisms.
Physical connections within an organism allow it to form a complex and
integrated functional unit. At the same time, by making bodies temporary
and assembling real living systems - ecologies and societies - out of
dynamic configurations of communicating organisms, nature achieves the
liquidity necessary for growth.

<P>It is difficult to assemble a complex living system from <STRONG>identical
functional bodies</STRONG> performing similar functions - there are too many
tasks to perform to put each of them within one organism.

<P>Therefore, functional bodies specialize.  Biological organisms
specialize, with different species performing different functions - that
happens in ecologies and early human societies, with domestication of
animals. In a human society, where a phenotypic variance is relatively
small, generic bodies can learn and integrate different skills. This is
still insufficient for unlimited growth, because of two reasons:

<P><STRONG>The physical abilities</STRONG> of an organism are limited, and
it is very difficult to develop additional functions through a
trial-and-error method.

<P>The following picture illustrates the appearance of a complex functional
entity if it permanently incorporated all useful functions in one physical
body.

</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><STRONG>Fig. 1 - <EM>In</EM>dividual</STRONG></CENTER>


<P>It is clumsy; the person would have to carry all specialized implements
everywhere, even when just one of them is needed. Evolving such a body
would also be difficult, as mutations in each function would have a smaller
and smaller influence on the survival of an organism, slowing the
evolutionary process. The solution here is a dynamic physical configuration.

</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><STRONG>Fig. 2 - Dividual</STRONG></CENTER>


<P>Here, the original organism forms a generic core that accepts attachments
and extensions on a permanent (learning) or temporary basis. The attachments
get tested and evolve independently, which dramatically speeds up the
development. Also, this allows specialized personality configurations
useful for social division of labor.

<P>This &quot;dividual&quot; construct lies in the foundation of human nature,
and even though accepting attachments takes a lot of learning and practicing,
and will never be done with the &quot;<STRONG>Plug and play</STRONG>&quot;
ease that we now implement in our computers. Still, it allows much faster
evolution than that previously achieved in the pre-human world.

<P><STRONG>In</STRONG>dividuals have their value and take pride in having
strong bodily features; for the next stage, the more important thing is to
own lots of resources and tools and be able to manipulate them, and take
part in the division of labor - that's exactly the current human perception
of self-worth.

<P>The <STRONG>second limitation</STRONG> of a human organism lies in the
limits of its <STRONG>functional abilities</STRONG> and architecture. So we
need to extend our memory and intelligence as well, which is what we are
trying to do now with the information technology.

<P>Human role/interface with attachments becomes increasingly abstract.
From finding and manipulating a tool we turn to communicating to it.
Ideally, we may just express our needs, and the tools will understand which
of them can do it, and how it should be done. In many cases, we no longer
take any part in making/&quot;compiling&quot; objects which may sometimes
create an illusion that this production process is gone.

&quot;We're starting a new chapter in

<P>I think that there are two processes here. One is that machines are
getting increasingly independent from the substrate, and second, that the
human role is shifting from compiling an object to creating a blueprint.
You can say that people also &quot;just compile&quot; objects out of ideas,
but since the production process takes a lot of human effort, it doesn't
look that simple. With computers, the compilation happens even more often,
but it is easier, and humans do not take part in it, so it may look like it
isn't there anymore.


<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Enhancements: Typology and recent developments</H2>

To discuss technological enhancements of humans, we need to define the
difference between naturally occurring human features and manufactured
technology. The common view states that <STRONG>natural things</STRONG> are
warm, soft, and fuzzy; that <STRONG>artificial things</STRONG> are cold,
square, and have sharp edges; and that a human is whatever resides within
the skin boundary. I would define technology as anything intentionally
designed, even if no external physical objects have been used. As for the
human identity, we can draw borders in different physical and functional
places. I personally identify more with my writings than with bacteria in
my stomach. The extensions can also be inside and outside the body or
programmed within natural bodily functions such as language, or other
artificial skills. I would like to suggest a classification of such
enhancements based on their positions relative to the body and the
functions they perform.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Extensions: types and functions</H2>

<H3>Types of extensions</H3>

<STRONG>Attachments and interfaces</STRONG> mediate our interaction with
the environment and usually are positioned on the surface of the body.
Although they could also be located inside it. For example, I would call a
receptor of X-rays an attachment, whether it is placed on the skin, or
inside the body. Physical objects would be called tools or attachments,
while information utilities would be called interfaces, but they basically
play the same role. We can call a shovel an interface.

<P><STRONG>Implants are internal enhancements</STRONG>. Most current
implants are replacements, such as an artificial bone. They fix an existing
function, rather than add a new one. Implants can also modify the functions
of the body - drugs are a good example here - or add new functions. Only a
few examples of implants currently add new functions, but we can imagine
the eventual development of internal memory backups, artificial
chromosomes, or PGP encryption of DNA.

<P>An interesting category of implants is <STRONG>functional
implants</STRONG> - they may be placed outside the body, but augment its
internal functions. For example, a thermometer: it allows us to see our own
body temperature in the way we naturally can't. Also, if you look at my
notes for this speech, they are outside of my body, but still are an
internal part of the lecture function, so I would also call them a
functional implant. Much of software can be also classified as functional
implants, as it augments our internal functions, such as memory and
information processing skills.

<P>What I call <STRONG>pseudo implants</STRONG> are external tools that
feel like natural functions. For example, you can program an external
filter to give you a signal when it notices an interesting object. This
object can be highlighted or otherwise distinguished for a moment, to give
you enough time to focus on it, but not enough to realize what triggered
your attention. In effect, you would instantly see your name in a text or
find Waldo in a puzzle as easily as you usually notice a source of loud
noise or a bright light. Such an enhancement would feel like an internal
function of your brain, though actually it is an external image
pre-processor.

<P><STRONG>Wrapper</STRONG> is a term from the theory of legacy systems.
Though not a special functional category, it still deserves a separate
mention. Wrapping is the comprehensive augmentation of a certain function,
when all or most contact of the original system with the environment becomes
mediated through a layer of technology.  Clothes are physical wrappers; our
digestive systems are effectively wrapped, as we rarely eat food that hasn't
been cooked, or at least cut, peeled or washed. A car is a transport wrapper
- while a walking stick is a transport aid.

<P>Implants are the most difficult enhancements, as the human body
<STRONG>does not have clean internal interfaces</STRONG> that would allow
easy physical combinations with technology. The external interfaces are a
lot more flexible. So during all of human history augmentation of the body
has been proceeding as additions of physically external elements, and most
likely, this process will continue for a while. A physically mixed system
is usually called a <STRONG>cyborg</STRONG>. I suggest to call a biological
system with <STRONG>external</STRONG> technological extensions a functional
cyborg, or a <STRONG><A HREF="Cyborgs.html">&quot;fyborg&quot;</A></STRONG>.

<P>In the following illustration, you can see a cyborg, a fyborg, a robot,
and a natural human. Actually, the human looks natural only from outside,
as she holds all kinds of artificially created concepts loaded into her
head. Humans without downloaded knowledge do not exist anymore.

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Fig. 3:  Cyborg, fyborg, robot, and human.</STRONG></CENTER>


<P>Another way of classifying the enhancements is by the <STRONG>functional
role</STRONG> they play in the extended body.

<H2>System functions</H2>

<H3>Manipulators</H3>

<STRONG>Manipulators</STRONG>, or <STRONG>effectors</STRONG>,
allow people to modify the environment.

<P>The first effectors were simple enhancements to human physical
functions; people used <STRONG>sticks, shovels, or spears</STRONG> to
augment their bodies. The general trend here runs toward growing
sophistication and independence of tools which perform more functions and
require less attention from a human. Weapons turned from sharpened sticks
to things that act at a distance.  With time, external tools started acting
by themselves - that includes <STRONG>fire, mills</STRONG>, etc. Machines
like <STRONG>mousetraps</STRONG> are already independent decision-making
agents; they enact the logic delegated into them by their owner. Software
agents are in principle the same thing, except they are more liquid. This
allows them to perform remote functions, replicate in the environment, and
perform many other function that physical implements cannot.

<H3>Sensors</H3>

Biological organisms possess <STRONG>two types of sensors</STRONG>: one to
allow them to identify their <STRONG>internal states</STRONG>, the other -
to <STRONG>analyze external conditions</STRONG>. Sensors of both types can
be augmented and connected in various ways. An example of enhanced internal
sensors is medical equipment that identifies the internal states that are
not usually reported in the organism itself.

<P>Most interesting things have been happening with <STRONG>sensing of the
environment</STRONG>. That includes collecting data from basically any
source and location in time and space, and delivering it - if necessary,
with change in representation - to human natural senses. Here we have
radio, television, books, telephones, the Internet, etc. The latest trend
here has been in increasing bandwidth and real-time interactivity. There
are many interesting examples in this category. I am sure you know about
work on remote input devices, such as cameras controlled over the Internet.

Recently I saw a demonstration of a
<A HREF="http://rhodes.www.media.mit.edu/people/rhodes/collab97.proposal.html">
compass belt</A> that buzzes on the side of your waist that is turned to
the North, so you can always &quot;feel&quot; how you are oriented. There
was also a suggestion to place taste buds on remote objects and transmit
the signal to the nerves of your tongue so that you could taste things
without actually touching them. I don't know whether you could
<STRONG>poison</STRONG> yourself like this, but you definitely wouldn't
<STRONG>gain weight</STRONG>.

<P>It is possible to <STRONG>substitute internal sensors for
external</STRONG> and vice versa. I already mentioned a thermometer that
allows you to see your own body temperature. All <STRONG>medical diagnostic
equipment and biofeedback</STRONG> devices belong to this category. It is
also possible to do a <STRONG>reverse conversion</STRONG>, and channel
information that would normally be perceived by external receptors, to
internal sensors. For example, you could have an implant that generates a
real <STRONG>pain in your neck</STRONG> each time the stock of your company
goes down. - With both a physical implant and pain in one suggestion this
of course sounds unpleasant. However, much of our pleasure and pain already
come through technology. While animals feel direct pleasure from their
productive behavior, human enjoyment from doing a good job usually comes
mediated through money and various things it can buy. So poor performance
of your investments <STRONG>does</STRONG> give you though indirect, but
quite noticeable pain in the neck. And in the sense of external body,
<STRONG>it is real pain</STRONG> and it goes through and registers in both
your artificial and biological parts.

<H3>Resource storage - materials, energy, memory</H3>

Resource storage was the first &quot;natural&quot; function to migrate
outside the body, starting with spare food items, followed by other kinds
of useful materials and energy, then representations of these things (such
as money and other contracts), and references to them - memory. At this
point, people store more materials, energy and values outside their bodies
than inside, and the external storage is often functionally superior to the
internal.

<P>Storage systems have become increasingly distributed, shared and
abstract, and also play an increasingly active role, deciding by themselves
what to store, when to accumulate the resource and when to disburse it.
Memory is probably the most interesting example here. Externally shared
memory appeared long time ago, with marks on stones and trees. Now most
objects around us are labeled, and a good half of our possessions is
comprised of either carriers of memory, such as texts, pictures, movies, or
music, or equipment for supporting and accessing it - from bookshelves to
desk lamps to video cameras and computers.

<P>A very interesting example of a memory enhancement is the
<A HREF=http://rhodes.www.media.mit.edu/people/rhodes/remembrance.html">
remembrance agent</A> created by
<A HREF="http://rhodes.www.media.mit.edu/people/rhodes/">Brad Rhodes</A> and
<A HREF="http://vismod.www.media.mit.edu/~testarne/">Thad Starner</A>
at <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media lab</A>. It memorizes things
that happen around you, and reminds you about them when you get into a
similar situation, providing active external associative memory.

<H3>Transports - physical, signal, semantic</H3>

Originally, organisms relied on favorable external forces to bring them
together with necessary resources. The next step was development of mobile
organisms - animals - that move around looking for resources (they also
provide transport services to other animals and plants that can reward them
for the service). Human transportation systems use technological carriers
to carry both people and resources where they are needed, a more efficient
way of connecting organisms and resources. Ultimately, the transport
function shifts from the organisms to technological systems.

<P>I would distinguish three layers of abstraction in value transports -
<STRONG>physical, signal, and semantic</STRONG>.

<P>Transport systems modify the effective geometry of the environment and
allow creation of integrated distributed systems that may eventually
replace a physical body as primary carriers of intelligence. Small
improvements in the quality of vehicles and infrastructure shrink the
effective metrics of the environment; new pathways and transportation
methods introduce structural changes in the geometry and even the <A
HREF="http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/pub/working.html">topology</A> of social
space.

<P><STRONG>Physical transports</STRONG> have been in use for thousands of
years, and we have seen more and more improvements in types of vehicles and
general infrastructure. New technologies, such as optimization of traffic,
new materials, alternative sources of energy, navigational aids, and smart
cars can bring dramatic improvements within the next few decades. My
favorite urban transportation fantasy is to have all traffic lights
removed, and have the cars move through intersections at 100 miles per
hour, negotiating rights of passage with the cars on the crossing streets
in real time, and paying each other for changing speed with digital cash.
Another interesting recent development is autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots. Building mobile robots still requires a lot of research in image
recognition, but in one area - aerial robotics - this is not necessary (not
much to bump into in the air yet). The specific difficulties of aerial
robotics, the need in lightweight equipment for position identification and
communication are now resolved with cellular modems and GPS. In the near
future, maybe 5 to 10 years from now, aerial robots would be able to
deliver small physical objects, observe remote locations (you can
&quot;walk&quot; one in a Paris museum, or fly it over the jungle, looking
for new species of birds). Small aerial robots may be also used for
delivering drugs, spying after people, stealing things, or anonymous
killing from the air. It seems that the features of small aerial robots -
airborne, cheap and anonymous - allow them to perform acts from which the
society has little protection. Introduction of aerial robots may deliver
multiple benefits and at the same time create quite a turmoil that will
only increase with the development of lots of swimming and running little
robots.</STRONG>

<P>When the environment becomes too complex, a new problem arises -
<EM>knowing </EM>which things to transport and where to bring them. Often,
people may be able to create necessary artifacts and transport them to
places where they are needed, but they cannot do so when they do not know
what to create and where they should deliver the products. As a result,
the social space is divided into a set of functional fragments reflecting
existing information pools, even though good transportation systems make
the physical environment relatively liquid.

<P>So the next stage is creation of an efficient system of signal transports
that can carry information about available resources. This allows greater
economic efficiency and faster growth, and also liberates exchange of ideas
from territorial limitations.

<P>Territorial power structures appeared under conditions when both
physical and signal communications were slow and expensive, and so
geographical boundaries determined the limits of cultural and economic
entities. The conditions are dramatically different now, and all local
structures are becoming less and less important. This means demise of
territorial sovereignty and national states, and obsolescence of
territorial wars in advanced economies.

<P>We have already reached the point where transportation of physical
objects, energy and information happens not as much between humans and
their tools, but among the tools themselves, with humans, at best,
overseeing the process. People still use both physical and information
transports as well. There are millions of vehicles people acquire every
year in USA alone to navigate the world - and the most favorite of them
is...
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html">
Netscape Navigator</A>.
<P>
After a certain stage of development of signal communications, they start
suffering from the same problem as physical transports: too much data and
too many signals that render it difficult to figure out what should go
where. Humans understand the semantics of signals, but each person has
knowledge of only a few areas of expertise and data sources, and is
increasingly overwhelmed even there.
<P>
Communication between these areas is imperfect because of semantic
barriers - most people do not know each other, the organizational mechanisms
of knowledge transfer between domains are relatively weak, and terminology
and interests differ, which creates conditions of &quot;reproductive
isolation&quot;  in the
<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Memetics/">memetic</A> ecology.

<P>
Now the <EM>semantic</EM> space is fragmented, although the
information environment is liquid, and we face a task similar to the one that
led to the creation of the signal communication industry. We need to make the
communication media aware of their content, and build a semantic transport
system that would take an increasing role in determining what data should
be stored and where, who should get signals and from which sources. This
system should also pass information about different sources of data from
one knowledge center to another.
<P>
Today, an increasing number of tools, from search engines to
<A HREF="ACF.html">collaborative filtering schemes</A>, store knowledge
about available data and fulfill not only the requests for particular data
items, but also requests for the type of desired knowledge, or even tell
you what they decide may relate to your interests.
<P>
At the advanced stage of this process, humans may play the role of
&quot;semantic sensors&quot;, assessing the meaning and value of particular
objects, and letting machines organize the global architecture of knowledge
flows.
<P>
<EM>This seems to be the general tendency in the evolution of all
enhancements. Originally, the tools, sensors, and transports were small and
specialized, while humans determined the system architecture and provided
general support and coordination. But now, humans specialize in creating
particular artifacts and assessing their quality, and the machine economy
provides the general structure. So each human is becoming a specialized
tool in the automated distributed system.</EM>

<P>It is likely that semantic transport will play as important a role in
the advanced information economy as signal and physical transports play in
the industrial age.

<P>According to statistics, physical transportation alone accounts for 40%
of all economic costs, depending on what you consider transportation. Is
swallowing food transportation? Is data transfer between computer processor
and memory transportation? If we divide things in this strict sense, into
<STRONG>transportation</STRONG>, when the object structure persists, but
location changes, and <STRONG>transformation</STRONG>, when the location
persists but the structure changes, then transportation may account for
90+% of the costs. Sometimes it is not easy to make distinctions. For
example, moving furniture from one wall to another may be considered
transportation of furniture, but transformation of the office.

<H3>Communication</H3>

There is more to communication than just data transfer. Recently, many new
tools have appeared for non-local real-time interaction between multiple
parties, from teleconferencing to mediated physical connections. An
interesting example here is the work of
<A HREF="http://www.merlin.com.au/stelarc/">Stelarc</A>, an Australian
performance artist. He created a pair of robotic suits that can be remotely
controlled.  If I wear one of the suits and walk, the information about the
position of my body can be transmitted to you over the Net, and the robotic
suit you wear will make you repeat all my movements. Or the right part of
my body can control the right part of your body, while your left part
controls my left part. We can walk or dance as one body.

<P>
Another interesting project is a device that allows people to automatically
<A HREF="http://www.areacom.it/html/arte_cultura/loris/tech.html"> exchange
personal data when they approach each other in the street</A>.

<P>Human abilities in communication are limited, and we are already close
to our maximal capacity. It seems that in a decade or two we will be able
to provide the maximal bandwidth that a human can perceive - that's a
dedicated link with high-quality video and audio into each home. All
further increase in data traffic will happen between the machines, so in
another decade the traffic received by humans may be relatively so small
that it may be delivered for free.

<P>Selectors and filters choose and transform physical or data inputs.
Information filters seem the most interesting.  There are many methods for
mediating our perception of the world, and the work here is just beginning,
so I will try to classify the enhancements that I think should appear in
the near future.

<H3>Perception filters and enhancements</H3>

All these tools need some device that can transform signals coming from
the world before they reach your senses. Many techniques are already used
in radio and TV programs, but I would like to see some real-time
transformation of signals coming from the real world - what I call <A
HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/EnhancedReality.html">Enhanced Reality</A>. Let us imagine that we
are looking at the world through some smart glasses that do some
pre-processing of incoming information. There are several kinds of tools I
can envision:

<P><STRONG>Volume</STRONG> and <STRONG>focus controls</STRONG> may allow to
adjust the level of the signal or select and amplify small but important
parts - for example, focus in on small or distant objects.

<P><STRONG>Calibration tools</STRONG> could expand the effective spectral
range of your perception through alteration of the frequency of the signal
to allow you to hear ultrasound or perceive X-rays and radio waves as
visible light.

<P><STRONG>Conversions </STRONG>between different types of signals may
allow you, for example, to <STRONG>&quot;see&quot; noise as fog</STRONG>
while enjoying quiet. Most popular conversion already takes place via
spoken and written language, by which we convert our experiences into a
symbolic form. In real-time communication such symbolism may be mixed with
the original message in a metaphoric form, for example your &quot;smart
glasses&quot; could display the chemical composition of materials as color
patterns. You can also convert the look of a good financial report into an
intense physical pleasure.

<P><STRONG>Artificial annotations</STRONG> to perceived images could
add text tags with names and descriptions to chosen objects, append warning
labels with skull and crossbones to radioactive objects, or surround angry
people with red auras. A person who has a reputation as a liar could
appear to have a long nose (as you see here on the picture). Entering a
high-crime area, people may see the sky darken and hear distant funeral music.

<P><STRONG>Reality filters</STRONG> may help you filter all signals
coming from the world just like your favorite mail reader filters your
messages, based on your stated preferences or advice from your peers. With
such filters you may choose to see only the objects that are worthy of
your attention, and completely remove useless and annoying sounds and images
(such as advertisements) from your view.

<P><STRONG>Perception utilities</STRONG> may give you additional information
in a familiar way -- project clocks, thermometers, weather maps, and your
current EKG readings on the wall in front of you, or honk a virtual horn
every time a car approaches you from behind. They could also build on existing
techniques that present us with recordings of the past and forecasts of the
future to help people develop an immersive trans-temporal perception
of reality.

<STRONG><P>&quot;World improvement&quot;</STRONG> enhancements could paint
things in new colors, put smiles on faces, caricaturize figures of your
enemies, change clothes on people you see to match your favorite fashion,
transform night into day, erase shadows and improve landscapes.

<P>Finally, completely <STRONG>artificial additions</STRONG> could project
northern lights, meteorites, and supernovas upon your view of the sky, or
populate it with flying toasters, or they could virtualize and superimpose
on the image of the real world your favorite mythical characters and
imaginary companions, and provide other educational and recreational
functions.

<P>In many cases, perception filters may provide us with more
<STRONG>true-to-life</STRONG> information than our &quot;natural&quot;
perception of reality. They could edit out mirages, show us our
&quot;real&quot; images in a <STRONG>virtual mirror</STRONG> instead of the
mirror images provided by the real mirror, or allow us to see through solid
objects. They could also show us many interesting phenomena that human
sensors cannot perceive directly and that we have thus far learned about
from science only in the symbolic form.

<P>Some of the interface enhancements can be made common, temporarily or
permanently, for large communities of people. This would allow people to
interact with each other using, and referring to, artificial extensions as
if they were parts of the real world, and build a &quot;<STRONG>mutual
reality</STRONG>&quot; of common perceptions and metaphors.

<P>Eventually, with all these filters, our contacts with &quot;<STRONG>raw
reality</STRONG>&quot; may become as rare as our consumption of raw meat.

<P>An interesting question here is who should have a right to control how
you perceive things. Can you morph your neighbors into pigs, or see them
naked, or demand that your image must be erased from the view of strangers?
Can you implement obscenity filters for your children, so they would never
hear bad words and see anything disturbing? Or can you design an
obscenity-enhancement filter for yourself? Will people fight for the
&quot;freedom of impression&quot; that would allow them to perceive the
world in a far more distorted way that any of today's drugs can possibly
do? Or will the government decide what constitutes an
&quot;<STRONG>approved perception of reality</STRONG>&quot;?

<P>Currently, the general view on extended self is, that whatever is within
your skin boundary, is your &quot;sacred natural
self&quot;, and nobody, including yourself, should modify, damage,
or sell any part of it. Things that are outside the skin, are
<STRONG>property</STRONG>, and occupy a very different status. With our
increasing ability to manipulate the biological parts, and our growing
dependence on technology, this attitude should eventually change. But
knowing humans, we can hardly expect that this process will be efficient
and peaceful.

<H3>Behavior of extensions: reactive and proactive</H3>

Another way to classify extensions is by the <STRONG>initiative</STRONG>
they take in performing their actions. Extensions can perform designated
tasks, which makes them into relatively passive tools - or they can
understand the interests of a person, and pursue them, finding things to do
and deciding how to do them. This is called <STRONG>proactive</STRONG>
behavior, and such extensions may be called <STRONG>agents</STRONG>.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Distant future</H2>

One of my favorite subjects in the evolution of the augmented self is the
issue of <STRONG>identity</STRONG>. It is interesting that my native
language, the Russian
language doesn't have a word for &quot;identity&quot;. Humans
<STRONG><EM>used</EM></STRONG> to not change that much. In good old times,
it used to be easy to understand what constituted an identity. It consisted
of things that were physically attached to your bones, things that belonged
to you, things you could feel, and things you could control, and all these
things were more or less the same. Now these categories are increasingly
different, and each of them is more and more dynamic. Things that you
control may not be attached to you, you can control things that do not
belong to you and aren't attached to anybody, parts of your physical body
or intelligence may be owned by someone else, etc.
<P>
Human rules of social interaction are based on the concept of the
permanence of human identity. Without it, some social rules may become
outmoded. For example, if a person breaks some laws, and then replicates
into lots of clones, and modifies himself beyond recognition, who should be
punished for the crime? If currently you may not be allowed into a court
with cameras, weapons, or drugs, then what will they do if you could turn
any part of your body into any of these things at any time? Would they
restrict the quality of your visual memory and monitor the chemical
composition of your blood stream?

<P>So the personal identity turns into an increasingly fluid and
reconfigurable thing. At some point, you may be able to change yourself
rapidly and dramatically - and every once in a while experience kind of
<STRONG>&quot;death forward&quot;</STRONG> - modification beyond
recognition, in which you will lose your identity, in any reasonable sense
of this word.

<P>
Most progress-oriented individuals would probably have very short
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/Identity.txt">identity life
spans </A> - and may not be interested in prolonging the lives of their
physical substrates. A truly
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Words/m.html#MORPHOLOGICAL_FREEDOM">
morphologically free</A>&quot; person may change all his parts and their
configuration, and preserve only the general goals. Though the goals will
drift too. Even with our current inflexible designs, our fundamental goals
and interests change several times during our lives. In advanced entities
such processes would speed up. The outside observer, with some stretch of
imagination, could still call such a sequence of goals, or
&quot;<STRONG>teleological thread</STRONG>&quot;, an identity, but the
entities themselves may feel very different about it.

<P>In the most distant future that I can envision, intelligent
entities will be extremely fluid and highly independent from the physical
substrate of the world.

suggested to call them
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Words/i.html#INFOMORPH">infomorphs</a>&quot;.
although this term assumes at least some functional identity. In the
real post-human future the identities may completely dissolve, and the
world will represent a mix of a superliquid economy, cyberspace anarchy
and distributed Artificial Intelligence. To current humans, it may look
like crazy functional soup.
