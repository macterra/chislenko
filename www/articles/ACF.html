<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P> Automated Collaborative Filtering of information
(ACF) is an unprecedented technology for distribution of opinions and ideas
in society and facilitating contacts between people with similar interests.
It automates and enhances existing mechanisms of knowledge distribution and
dramatically increases their speed and efficiency. This allows to optimize
knowledge flow in the society and accelerate the evolution of ideas in
practically all subject areas. ACF also provides a superior tool for
information retrieval systems that facilitates users' navigation in the sea
of information in a meaningful and personalized way. This technology can be
viewed as a <EM>semantic transport</EM> - a social utility that, after
physical and data transports, transfers increasingly abstract and
intelligent objects between previously isolated fragments of the social
organism. As an artificial system that integrates and processes knowledge
of multiple human participants, ACF represents an intermediate stage
between human and purely artificial intelligence and lays the foundation
for the future knowledge processing industry. This article discusses the
premises and the historical analogs of ACF technology and suggests its
possible uses as well as long-term economic and social implications.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Premises of Automated Collaborative Filtering</H2>

<H3>Information flows in the society</H3> <P> Social mechanisms of
knowledge distribution represent a formative factor for all spheres of
social life. It is the advantages of sharing knowledge among individuals
that, together with benefits of group work, led to the development of
language, symbolic thinking, and specialization of labor. The rate of
social progress is to a large degree determined by the availability of
standardized and affordable communication tools. The transaction costs of
the social communication infrastructure define the scales and
interrelations of social institutions. Effective mechanisms for collecting
and publishing aggregate opinions of the population are a crucial factor
for democratic governance; similar mechanisms for establishing balanced
product and share prices form a signaling foundation of a market
economy.</P>

<H3>Collaborative filtering of information</H3>

<P>While generalized, or
aggregate, information is essential for balancing social processes on the
macro-scale, it is usually not sufficient for suggesting optimal behavior
to any particular person. For making efficient personal selections, people
have to possess both necessary general knowledge and special information
relevant to their particular situation. For collecting necessary
information, one has to choose what objects to pay attention to. In early
human history, each person was familiar with the whole environment and,
after gaining experience with most available things and people, could
decide what to explore further. However, this strategy cannot work in a
more complex society, when one is faced with more objects and people than
he can even sample. This situation requires exchange of personal experience
among individuals and sharing personal advice on many particular issues. If
a person needs to make a decision in an unknown situation, he can talk to
his friends, and follow their suggestions. Here, one's circle of
acquaintances effectively plays the role of an information filter,
suggesting most relevant options and leads for further exploration.
</P>

<P>With increasing variety of areas of expertise and value judgments, the
opinions of a few chosen individuals and the averaged opinion of the
society become insufficient for providing advice for all of one's
decisions. In this situation, larger-scale collaboration in information
filtering becomes increasingly important. Individuals seeking advice query
people with similar interests whom they trust, collect their opinions and
choose the options selected by the majority of the most knowledgeable
people. This is very often the way we select places for vacation, books,
movies, or <A HREF="http://www.trabble.com">restaurants</A>. If none of
the people we ask have any experience
with a specific item, some of them may still know something about it, if
they have heard about it from others. If someone cannot recommend an item
of interest, they may still be able to refer us to another person who we
may ask about it. This is the &quot;word of mouth&quot; method of information
distribution in a society.</P>

<H3>Active Collaborative Filtering</H3>

<P> Querying people is a useful method for finding information when you
know you need it, or when you think something new might have appeared. This
method may be called &quot;user pull&quot;, as you have to expend an effort to pull
the knowledge out of the passive environment. However, it is not always
sufficient, especially in cases when you do not know what questions to ask,
or something totally new has happened, or your contacts find out something
they couldn't have told you about before.</P>

<P>
<EM>Active collaborative filtering</EM> helps you in such cases, by bringing you
information you need when someone in your community discovers it. Information can
&quot;find&quot; you in
two ways. First, you can ask people to let you know whenever they learn
something exciting, new, or relevant in some area. Second, people who know
you can share information if they decide you can benefit from it. In both
cases, after learning about your needs or preferences, members of the
community take an active role in supplying you with important knowledge. We
can say that the community actively &quot;pushes&quot; the information towards
you.</P>

<H3>Limitations of existing filtering methods</H3>

<P>Traditional methods of knowledge distribution become very inefficient
when the size and complexity of a society far outpace the ability of
anyone's circle of acquaintances to monitor events. The modern
communication system transmits billions of messages daily, and many of
them may be of great interest to you. You can also easily access any of the
millions of available books, magazines, songs, movies or Internet
resources. However, finding people who have looked at the things you may
like and whose opinions you might trust can be very difficult. You do not
know most of these people, so you can not hope that they will know - or
care - to tell you when they find something of interest to you. Even if you
could overcome these difficulties, it would still be impossible to retain
opinions of thousands of people in your mind and decide which of them to
follow.</P>

<P>The hope here rests on machines. In their evolution as knowledge
carriers machines have repeated the early stages of the development of
human information sharing techniques. They have been taking an increasing
role in storage, transmission and averaging of opinions. Now it is time for
machines to take on the more sophisticated tasks of automated information
filtering.</P>

<H2>Introduction to Automated Filtering</H2>
<P>When too much information
exists, reliance on human connections for finding exactly what you want
becomes inefficient, because people, smart as they are, have limited
capacity to store and share information. </P>

<P>The traditional solution to this problem has been to store data outside
the human mind, and let people search through it. Recently, with the advent
of computer systems, machines also began performing searches for
information. So now information seekers have two kinds of helpers: people
who can understand your interests, but are slow and inefficient in handling
data; and computers that are fast and cheap, but still too stupid to
understand the meaning of the material and judge what is good and relevant.
Still, we want help that is both fast and intelligent.</P>

<P>Attempts to speed up humans or smarten machines have not been too
successful thus far. The solution that allows us to perform information
searches with human intelligence and at machine speeds, however, is
relatively simple: record people's opinions on the importance and quality
of the material, and use these records to improve the results of computer
searches. This technology is called Automated Collaborative Filtering
(ACF). It can also be viewed as an example of Synthetic Intelligence (SI) -
a system combining human and machine knowledge processing strengths. ACF
allows people to find others with similar opinions, discover experts in a
field, analyze the structure of people's interests in various subject
domains, facilitate creation of interest groups, decentralize communication
media, improve targeting of announcements and advertisements, and do many
other useful things that, together with other intelligent technologies,
promise to bring the information economy to new levels. As distribution of
opinions does not require knowing the physical identity of the persons
sharing and receiving advice, the automated filtering systems (with
appropriate software tools) may become the most secure channel of knowledge
sharing in history.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Historical Stages: Physical, data, and semantic
transports</H2>

<H3>Ancient history: Physical transports.</H3>

<P>
The creation of the physical transport system was, in a sense, analogous to
the development of mobile organisms. The difference is that in an ecology,
organisms move around looking for resources; in an economy, resources
usually get delivered to organisms, which is a smarter way to connect them
in complex systems. The important point here is that ultimately, the
transport function shifts from the organisms to synthetic (technological)
systems.</P>

<P>Transport systems modify the effective geometry of the environment. The
important metric in the social space is how much time and resources it
takes to move things from one place to another. We could create a map of a
territory, &quot;distorted&quot; so that the distance between two points is
proportional to the time (or cost) of traveling between these points. If we
use such a map to track the evolution of the transportation system, we will
see that with time, distances contract in all directions, most rapidly
along the most important connections. Small improvements in the quality of
vehicles and infrastructure reflect the general contraction of the space
metrics; new roads and transport methods represent structural changes in
geometry and even topology of the social space. We can visualize this
impact as new dimensions added to the space or new shortcuts opened between
various objects. Advanced transportation infrastructure creates a social
circulatory system that helps transform a set of isolated production
locales into an integrated economic environment.</P>

<STRONG><P>Modern history: data/signal transports</P> </STRONG>

<P>Since there is a great variety of resources to move and travel to, a new
problem arises - <EM>knowing </EM>what to get and how to handle it. Some of
this knowledge is embedded in our bodies. In other cases, organisms'
generic biological skills can be utilized by the social system. So humans
spend a good part of their history memorizing and sharing ways to handle
things - eventually overloading their ability to exchange information.
People may be near the objects they need, but they can not see them
directly, or get advice from others - and so they cannot utilize important
resources. People may be able to create necessary artifacts and transport
them to places where they are needed, but often they cannot do so, as they
do not know what to create and where they should deliver the products. As a
result, the social space is divided into a set of functional fragments
reflecting existing information pools, even though good transportation
systems make the physical environment relatively liquid.</P>

<P>To ameliorate this situation, people improve their artificial ways of
storing and transmitting data. Efficient information exchange mechanisms
re-integrate the economic space, and accelerate economic progress beyond
what physical transport could do alone. These mechanisms also allow further
leaps in complexity. Now, with today's sophisticated information technology
that can transport data electronically as well as physically, people just
have to decide who and what to contact; the technological tools allow
people to maintain relationships with distant objects, organizations and
friends as if they were located next to them.</P>

<P>Consequential benefits of this stage include greater economic
efficiency, faster growth, demise of territorial sovereignty, and shift of
importance to functional power centers. As conflicts migrate from
territorial to functional structures, weapons change from guns to words and
bank accounts. Informational entities are torn apart daily in intense
economic and cultural competition, while physical bodies feel less pain.
Deterritorialization of power structures and obsolescence of the
territorial/physical warfare between advanced economies are among the
benefits of the information revolution.</P>

<P>Topologically, the effect of fast signal transports is equivalent to the
collapse of the social space metric along established social
connections.</P>

<P>In the distant future, we may learn how to cost-effectively synthesize
any physical artifact on the spot (e.g., by nanoassembly or manipulation of
vacuum microstructure), and send high-bandwidth signals at light speed
between any two points. Then, the physical space will effectively collapse,
and its intrinsic topology will be of as little interest to system
designers as details of physical representation of bits are to today's
software engineers. The 15-billion-year struggle of functional structures
for independence from physical substrate that is now experiencing such a
magnificent growth spurt, will be mostly complete, allowing the world to
finally concentrate on its real tasks - development of complex, balanced,
flexible systems not limited by the shortcomings of any particular
substrate.</P>

<H2>Further development: Semantic transports</H2>

<P>Now we encounter the next obstacle: so much data, so many signals. Even
the powerful machines are overloaded with data. Information traffic, partly
due to its relatively low cost, becomes horribly inefficient. Many media,
from newspapers to USENET, try to send everything to everybody. As a
result, while people already read as much as they possibly can, most of the
increase in information traffic is never read. A typical reader of <EM>New
York Times</EM> may read 5% of the paper, and a typical reader of USENET
may consume 0.01% of the daily news traffic coming to his server.
(Multimedia gives a one-time increase in bandwidth demand, but the main
tendency is still the same). The &quot;Internet visionaries&quot; debate whether
increased capacities of physical cables may provide the projected increase
in data transfer, and billions of dollars are spent on attempting to fix
information problems using physical methods. That's a step back by a level!
Instead, we should move a level forward and look at the message semantics.
Then, we could transmit only the messages that are actually going to be
read.</P>

<P>The problem here is that while machines store and pass messages, they do
not know what to store and where to pass it. So, they process everything.
Humans understand what to handle, and how to handle it. But people's
semantic abilities are at least as limited as their skills in handling
material objects and storing and transmitting data, so each person has to
specialize in a few isolated areas of opinions and expertise. Communication
between these areas is imperfect because of semantic barriers - most people
do not know each other, the organizational mechanisms of knowledge transfer
between domains are relatively weak, and terminology and interests differ
(conditions of &quot;reproductive isolation&quot; in the memetic ecology).
</P>

<P>The <EM>semantic</EM> space is fragmented, though the information
environment is liquid. So here we face a task similar to the one that led
to the creation of the [signal] communication industry: to build a semantic
transport system that would take an increasing role in determining what
data should be stored and where, who should get signals and from which
sources, and how to structure social mechanisms.</P>

<P>In this scenario, machines begin by collecting data from people about
what they know, have, like and want, and assist in figuring out what kinds
of connections should be made. Then, the machines can suggest these
connections to humans (&quot;check out X!&quot;) or partly execute selected
transactions (&quot;Here is something you may want to know/do&quot; - that is,
machine chooses the source, and you decide whether you want to be the
recipient, or vice versa). Machines can even act independently for your
benefit, e.g., perform market transactions on your behalf, or upgrade your
computer with a program liked by similar users - according, of course, to
your preferences and instructions.</P>

<P>Consequences here are similar to those of the data revolution, but on
another level: growing semantic liquidity and integration, higher effective
complexity of the social environment, and even faster growth. At the
advanced stage of this process, humans may play the role of &quot;semantic
sensors&quot;, assessing the meaning and value of objects in their vicinity, and
letting machines organize the global architecture of value flows.</P>

<P>This is virtually opposite to the human role in a primitive physical
economy: then, measuring and sensing devices (thermometers, clocks,
watchdogs) played specialized roles in monitoring and enhancing the
environment, while humans determined the system architecture and provided
general support and coordination. But now, humans specialize in creating
particular artifacts and assessing their quality, and the machine economy
provides the general structure. (At this point, most of the architectural
structure of the economy is non-biological, so its further de-humanization
should be relatively painless.)</P>

<P>It is likely that semantic transport will play as important a role in
the advanced information economy as signal and physical transports played
in the industrial age. Twenty percent of the global economy by the year
2030? This may sound like an exaggeration. However, people already spend at
least as large a share of their time and effort on collecting and sharing
expertise. What is needed here is automation of this process. If we look at
the acceleration of automation and data processing and extrapolate the
trend, 30 years may seem sufficient for development of a knowledge
processing industry. We can hardly expect that collection, distribution and
sharing of expertise - the most valuable social resource in the coming era
- would be done by unpaid and unorganized enthusiasts in their spare from
other tasks time, without assessing costs and benefits. Most likely,
effective cooperation among contributors and beneficiaries of knowledge
flows will call for more wide-spread usage of value accounting, and
ultimately build the <EM>wisdom economy</EM> of the future.</P> <STRONG>

<P>Trends in the evolution of transports</P> </STRONG> <P>The distinctions
of physical, data and semantic transports may seem somewhat forced, as
would any other simple subdivision of a complex process. The fact remains
that exo-biological systems take an ever increasing role in storing,
transporting and processing structures valuable for biological individuals,
and the involvement of the technology in these functions is ever more
active and intelligent. A wheelbarrow filled with stone tablets already
represents an external mobile transport of abstract references, although
the message is still too deeply engraved in the medium, and the whole
transport is passive and unaware of its function. During the course of
history, value transports become increasingly abstract, changing physical
carriers without human involvement, testing their own integrity and
assuring delivery, processing the entrusted values, and ultimately,
accepting a greater role in deciding what should be shared, where it should
be sent, and how it should be processed. To build this new semantic
transport, we need to create the global information infrastructure, with
open standards for semantically rich descriptions of objects and their
relations allowing for diversity of opinions on the same subjects and
access control for different parties. We also need comprehensive feature
and interest ontologies, to describe the structure of the environment, a
variety of algorithms that would form the brain of this system, and an
extensive amount of knowledge loaded into it by multiple participants.</P>

<P>The development of technology in any area goes through a similar set of
stages. At each stage a new level of human abilities first becomes
explicitly expressed in non-biological constructs, then independently
carried, then carried out (all things that are started by humans and
continue functioning on their behalf, from campfires to mousetraps to stock
trading programs), then combined and processed, then get taken over. This
has already happened, consecutively, with the handling of physical
materials, energy, and raw information. Pursuit of AI, though a worthy
goal, may have been an attempt to leapfrog the natural
cooperative/mixed/synthetic stage in the area of object semantics. Now we
are filling this gap. Human judgments have been expressed in artificial
media for a long time, communication industry gave us efficient tools for
transporting them. Automated processing of opinions is still in a very
primitive stage (e.g., ballot counting systems), but ACF technology
promises to significantly raise its level. After this is accomplished, the
next layer of human functionality to be taken over will probably be
semantic analysis of objects. The work here has already begun, with pattern
recognition and signal processing techniques, and commonsense information
analysis tools on the higher end. Existence of semantic transport
infrastructure will allow immediate utilization of advances in automated
semantic analysis, which should greatly accelerate its development. An
analog here is text analysis tools that after the emergence of the World
Wide Web became crucial for daily information searches of millions of
people, and turned information retrieval from an area of orderly academic
activity into an arena of intense commercial competition.</P>

<H3>Economic promises of semantic transport</H3>

<P>Strictly speaking, ACF, as well as data communications, starts with
transporting <EM>references</EM> to existing values, rather than the values
themselves. Reference transport optimizes the flows of underlying values.
This allows references themselves to be recognized as values, and then the
new mechanism turns into a value transport in the full sense. In the
current society, though money can be easily passed from one agency to
another, many crucial areas of economic and social activity are
under-funded, as their importance is not recognized (though all necessary
information may be available somewhere, it can remain unknown or ignored by
people with money). In many cases, people have no incentive to share their
knowledge with others, as in many areas there are no mechanisms to
compensate them for sharing the knowledge. So instead of just telling other
people what they know, which would be the least expensive way to provide
the maximal social benefit, they attempt to realize that knowledge in
something non-transportable, so that they can control the distribution of
benefits and profit from it (though these implementations often could be
realized faster and cheaper by other people if they knew about them). The
creation of reward mechanisms for knowledge distribution, in terms of
enhanced social reputation of the individual, as well as direct payment for
advice based on the utility of previous opinions expressed by the same
person, may give people incentives to share some of the knowledge - e.g.,
observations of the economy, or ideas for inventions - in the areas where
they tend to keep information proprietary today. This would result in less
antagonistic relationships between an individual and society, conservation
of resources, and acceleration of progress.</P>

<H2>Applications of ACF in the near future</H2>

<P>ACF provides multiple functions. Let us examine them and see how they
may be used.</P>

<H3>Finding objects of desire</H3>

<P>People spend a lot of time trying to find the best objects to satisfy
their interests. In the process, they waste a lot of effort looking through
junk, find some occasional surprises (serendipity is a side benefit of bad
searches), and miss many gems that might have made their lives much better.
Email and Web access dramatically increased the efficiency of information
searches and distribution, but did not modify the nature of the mechanisms.
Improving this search process would increase quality of life and accelerate
the adoption of new and worthy products and ideas. This would save
resources and increase the rate of social and economic progress.</P>

<P>An interesting issue here is that recommendations delivered by ACF come
from the person's affinity groups, and are more geared towards the person's
interests than suggestions from mass-media channels, whose choice
recommendations are linked to the power interests of a small number of
commercial and political organizations. This could very well lead to
decentralization and democratization of influential powers in the society,
even for mainstream interests. I would like to stress that I divide
interests into fringe and mainstream here, not people. For example, my
interest in philosophy may be fringe, but my health and nutrition interests
may be quite typical. I would expect that the ACF-enhanced system would be
more likely to recommend apple juice over Coca-Cola than would commercial
advertising. The effect on the economy should be a greater incentive for
companies to tailor both their products and marketing messages to consumer
interests rather than to manipulate people's opinions. &quot;Producer push&quot;
in value exchanges would give some space to &quot;consumer pull&quot;.</P>

<P>Implications for fringe interests are still more promising. People who
are interested in rare objects or obscure issues usually get no social
messages targeted at them at all. ACF may provide them with advice whose
quality matches that of wider spheres of interest. ACF can also benefit
people who have interests in the mainstream subjects, but who have opinions
different from those of others - they may be trying to do something new, or
have finer or exotic tastes. For these individuals, ACF can deliver advice
corresponding to their preferences. Such functions will allow ACF systems
to support the diversity of tastes and interests and encourage their
development, while preventing alienation.</P>

<P>Some caveats exist here as well. If people's expertise and tastes in
some area are underdeveloped, a straightforward ACF system might provide
them with the advice of their &quot;laggard&quot; affinity group that may give them
support but not help in developing beyond their current level.</P>

<P>The hopes here are:</P>


<UL>
<LI>if people advance in their current interest faster due to ACF, and
at the same time get better advice from other social channels, they can
still evolve faster.</LI>

<LI>it is possible to design ACF algorithms so that they can track the
development paths of other people interested in a particular area -
noticing, for example, that people who study arithmetic or rap music today
are likely to turn to algebra or rock tomorrow - and give them advice aimed
at helping them move ahead.</LI>
</UL>


<P>Soon, ACF technology as an information search method will join the ranks
of established information retrieval tools, and will make information
retrieval systems more intelligent and adaptable. Increasingly
semantics-rich information systems will include elements of ACF
functionality as integral parts, and will use them to adjust their
communications with humans and each other, building representations of the
environment more suitable for their tasks. This includes negotiation of
&quot;consensus ontologies&quot; for different subject areas, and building models of
people's interests that would help refine searches for information. Later,
automated content analysis tools based on &quot;common sense knowledge bases&quot;
may aid humans in evaluating item semantics.</P>

<P>The ACF methods should not necessarily be based on the straightforward
matching of people's interests. One group of people can be interested in
materials that another group considers offensive or controversial;
educators would pay special attention to things that students find too
difficult or boring; researchers may be interested in problems that have
puzzled their colleagues or have not received sufficient attention; social
scientists and market analysts would study subjects experiencing rapid
changes in levels of public interest or shifts of opinions; reviewers would
look for new or unknown material in promising areas; fashion watchers may
pay attention to things rising in popularity. As a result, the ecology of
knowledge may establish productive information exchanges among groups that
previously didn't find much in common. (Let us hope that this information
will not be used for hostile purposes too often).</P>

<H3>Finding like-minded people </H3>

<P>This is a very important function of ACF, just as it is of many social
mechanisms. Finding people who share your interests is important for
finding further directions in life, starting social and economic
activities, forming friendships and families, getting advice on important
personal decisions<EM>, </EM>and feeling more confident and stable in the
social environment. Many people abandon ideas of businesses or social
undertakings, or feel depressed and alienated only because they cannot find
other individuals who share their interests, even though those people may
pass them in the street, or could be reached in a few seconds with a phone
call. ACF can help you find kindred spirits wherever you go - just express
your preferences, and you will find that the person in the next theater
seat shares your interests in the arts, that your neighbor at a business
banquet table is thinking of hiring somebody with your qualifications, and
that the person in the airplane seat next to yours is single, fits all your
dating criteria and shares your political affiliations and musical tastes.
Some day, you might even be able to find people sharing such bizarre
interests as the historical subject of social alienation in the pre-ACF
era.</P>

<P>The social functions of ACF can be supplemented by other Automated
Collaboration (AC) techniques, such as group scheduling, multi-user games,
teleconferencing, groupware, etc., that would facilitate all kinds of
activities among like-minded people.</P>

<H3>Finding people who may like a certain object or idea</H3>

<P>The mechanism that refers people to things and ideas they may like, may
also work the other way, to help things and ideas find people who may like
them. So it may be not clear whether the whole process will help people
pursue things, or help things to pursue people. In any thing-person
encounter, the beneficiary is some interest that may or may not reside
within that person. If this interest is friendly to the recipient of the
connection, we have the previously described optimistic scenarios. However,
the interest may easily be hostile or manipulative. One may imagine
personalized ads that would suggest snake oil to the people who are most
likely to be gullible, at the maximum price they could pay for it, or
political campaigns where the message delivered to each citizen will say
exactly what this person &quot;needs&quot; to hear to decide in favor of this
particular politician, and various other versions of &quot;personalized truth&quot;
and manipulative messages. Considering that the development of ACF, just as
most other technologies, is propelled by pursuit of commercial gains and
power more than by search for truth and general social progress, this
potential is quite alarming.</P>

<H2>Social consequences of ACF</H2>
<P>Historically, the development of
physical and signal transports has led to democratization of these areas;
travel and communication are widely available in developed countries, and
the gap between the elite and the general populace now is narrower than
ever. However, the development of the industrial and information economies
was far from peaceful and democratic, and was characterized by huge
inequalities and other unpleasant phenomena, from wars over resources to
mass brainwashing. In the end, the social powers came to a new equilibrium,
and the grass-roots power of the increasingly well informed populace
balanced the stronger but indiscriminate influence of new political and
economic elites.</P>

<P>Could the new industry of personalized knowledge delivery overpower the
existing mechanisms of grass-roots communications and upset this historical
balance? Maybe we will be lucky, and the logic of the next stage of
technological development will magically coincide with general interests of
humankind and the needs of social progress and stability. But, this has
never happened before. Or, perhaps, people will wake up and pass their
development powers to benevolent visionaries. This has never happened
either...</P>

<H3>A pessimistic scenario:</H3>

<P>People will find themselves surrounded by a host of intelligent reactive
information systems. Most people will have no idea of what is going on, and
everybody will just hope that they can find some value in the new
situation, while tolerating the bad effects. Governments and businesses
will develop semi-intelligent solutions with predictable economic
efficiency (different for these two), but mostly with localized benefits
and random social effects. People who prefer emotional stability to
intellectual growth will form comfortably stagnant communities and shield
themselves from disturbing and challenging influences. Fringe sociopathic
people with perverse interests will for the first time find secure and
efficient ways to organize and communicate. The governments will cite the
&quot;urgent necessity&quot; of protecting some obscure parts of the population from
whatever the officials consider criminal, and pressure the system to
incorporate snooping technologies and censoring rules. Politicians and
marketers will do their best to brainwash the population. Socially
responsible thinkers will play about as little a role as they ever did.</P>

<P>Still, ACF can do something for visionaries, too: it can help them form
their own common interest groups on the semantic fringes of the society,
and the wise folks will at least have some pleasure jointly observing the
events.</P>

<H3>The preferred scenario:</H3>

<P>ACF systems will provide a responsive semantic network designed by
people and for people, as an expression of their interests and aspirations.
Ideas coming from incompetent or malevolent forces will get caught in the
global memetic sieve before they could influence a sizable part of the
population. Good and useful ideas and opinions will proliferate and be
distributed with unprecedented speed to all who need them, while people who
produce and recommend these ideas will earn great respect from their
audiences, further increasing their ability to influence events.</P>

<P>Life will most likely be more complex than these scenarios, especially
if one considers that ACF will never be the sole factor shaping the
society. Whether ACF may soon start offering strong positive contributions
to the lives of many people depends largely on the vision and efforts of
the people who develop and promote this technology.</P>

<H2>Further applications of ACF</H2>

<H3>Managing personal resources</H3>

<P>A common problem in an advanced society, and one that has not received
sufficient attention because of lack of commercial interest, is that of
ubiquitous <EM>junk</EM>. In the good old cave times, keeping track of
one's few belongings was easy; today, people seem to be drowning under
piles of personal possessions. The problem becomes even more difficult with
data objects, as low delivery costs and virtually unlimited storage
potential make the accumulation of one's intellectual possessions
overwhelming, while efficient handling of personal information becomes more
and more crucial.</P>

<P>A typical personal computer today contains several thousand files, many
of which have hundreds or thousands of records. Without effective
management, these information repositories are becoming &quot;write-only
memory&quot;. The evolution of managing methods here is repeating the path of
larger systems. Originally, people just remembered all their files. Then,
the software allowed organized storage and searches for data. The recent
generation of PIMs - Personal Information Managers - allows for more
flexible and meaningful organization of personal information. However, the
task of classifying and managing thousands of aging pieces of information
on a PC becomes a challenge even for a seasoned professional. The
&quot;Miscellaneous&quot; category acquires thousands of diverse materials; searches
by keywords become difficult (&quot;What was that thing that I got recently from
some good friend of mine that I thought I'd do something with?&quot; - try this
with keywords!) In many cases, one doesn't even remember to look for
something...</P>

<P>Intelligent software agents promise to alleviate these problems by
remembering all activity on a computer, deriving patterns from the user's
behavior to help classify and prioritize messages and otherwise manage
their &quot;external memory&quot;. But here we face the usual hard problems of
building good AI. At this point, PC intelligence is far too limited to
build reasonable classifications of data and figuring out which messages
are important, except for a few cases with usual topics and regular
correspondents. Even with good intelligence, users wouldn't receive very
useful advice, if an agent's knowledge is derived only from one user's
limited personal experience.</P>

<P>The first generation of software for managing personal resources has
already appeared on the market. The next stage may be expected to include
elements of ACF, such as recorded opinions of human experts in one's sphere
of interests, recommendations of like-minded people, and object
classification and information retrieval rules derived from their personal
information-handling patterns by their own software agents. From this
stage, the software servants may be constantly at work exchanging
experiences with each other, generalizing it for related groups of tasks,
negotiating subject ontologies, etc. With time, most of the &quot;semantic
traffic&quot; will consist of messages created by one machine for the
consumption of others, as has already happened with storage, transportation
and processing of physical materials, energy and information.</P>

<P>With good information protection technologies, people could trust the
large servers with storage of their personal data, to ensure its security
and accessibility from anywhere in the world. Then, the search for personal
information can be provided by the same tools as the global or company-wide
search, with consideration of access rights.</P>

<P>Eventually, the knowledge of our habits and preferences will be
distributed in, or available to, all our tangible possessions, from the
toaster to the walls of our houses. As appliances acquire the physical and
intellectual skills necessary for physical mobility - make the transition
analogous to that between plants and animals - the benefits of information
processing we have been discussing will extend to include manipulation of
physical objects. Mobile possessions will rearrange themselves and other
appliances for our convenience, discover and bring us things we may
consider of interest, take us to destinations, and drive along the paths,
that we are likely to enjoy the most.</P>

<H3>Reputation brokering system</H3> <P>With a natural progression of a
human from a biological creature to a relatively individual tool
manipulator to a part of a technological system, the perception of human
value shifted correspondingly - from bodily strengths, to the amount of
personal possessions, to the value of knowledge and experience necessary
for taking part in an integrated economy. In today's economy, reputation -
the perception by the community of the utility of one's socially productive
skills - often represents the single most valuable asset of a person or an
organization and plays an important role in most social and economic
interactions. However, there has been little intentional effort to widen
the use of this important social tool. ACF technology can make a
considerable contribution here, collecting, maintaining and distributing
knowledge of people's reputations.</P>

<H3>Example of reputations: People's Better Business Bureau / Consumer
reports</H3>

<P>Many people feel suspicious of plumbers and car mechanics, as they tend
to under-perform and overcharge. However, these people do not have
different DNA from everybody else's, and their occupations are not legally
limited to the members of the National Crook Guild. The problem is that
these businesses have little incentive to perform more responsibly. The
customer does not have sufficient expertise to personally control the work
of these people, and usually has no access to the opinions of previous
customers regarding their services. The business then does not feel
motivated enough to give the customer the best service and price, as the
excess charges would enrich it directly, while the negative opinion of the
customer is unlikely to repel other potential clients.</P>

<P>This situation would change dramatically if the opinions on previous
jobs became publicly accessible. If you need to get any service, you would
ask the ACF system for a list of business evaluations, and select the
service based on the combined knowledge of people similar to you in income,
place of residence, service requirements, and cultural preferences.</P>

<P>The system is not necessarily immune from abuse, as bad servicemen might
ask their friends to enter fake references for their businesses. However,
people whose recommendations appear misleading, would see their own
reputations - and influences - decrease in the system. This would provide
an incentive to people to be truthful, and will make sure that people who
tend to give bad advice, will not harm others too much. If the system
rewards the providers of good advice (would you pay 25 cents for a
reference to the most experienced and honest car mechanic in your area?),
then people with the most valuable consumer expertise may find themselves
employed as paid consumer advisors. If the system can transport values, it
can transport rewards as well - collection and distribution of incentives
for providing useful references and reviews may become a key part of a
collaborative system ensuring &quot;positive value feedback&quot;.</P>

<H3>Reputations vs. brands</H3>

<P>Direct references to the company and product quality, coming from
independent sources and tied to the interests of the particular user, seem
far superior to the current simple method of building product reputation -
<EM>branding</EM>. The &quot;brand awareness&quot; is often built by massive
advertising that wins one company or product a place in the limited
consumer memory, at the expense of other brands. This familiarity with the
brand often depends more on the size of the company and its advertising
budget than on the quality of any particular product. Companies can exploit
brand popularity gained from previous successes to push new products with
non-optimal value/cost combinations to a market that does not know how to
choose better, and prevent new rivals with cheaper and superior products
from gaining the recognition they deserve. As better mechanisms for product
recommendations appear, we may see brand advertising drift towards
obsoletion, as the products will be judged and recommended based on their
actual values and costs. The general reputation of a company or a product
line would still be important, as they would provide additional guarantees
of consumer service and product quality, which is especially important for
introduction of new products to the market. However, this reputation will
be built more on the consumers' aggregate opinion on the quality of the
product, than on the all-too-familiar non-informative ads. In many cases,
especially for new products, in addition to - or even instead of - the
producer's reputation, the consumer would rely on the reputation of the
<EM>critics</EM> - such as Consumer Reports, Environmental Protection
Agency or his own friends, to decide whether he should purchase this
product from this particular company. This will also give incentives to the
critics to improve the quality of their product - advice - on the market of
ideas.</P>

<H3>Advertising and attention economy</H3>

<P>Signal economy, as most other things, works well on a certain scale. In
the absence of intelligent message targeting, the larger the signal
environment, the more there is competition for public attention, and the
louder the signals should be to be heard. People need to hear the whole
message to assess its meaning, but they may turn away from it if it does
not catch their attention. So the message has to be loud, sparkling and
shocking from the very beginning. It needs to SCREAM to be heard. Assuring
this becomes the essence of the marketing profession. Meanwhile, the
audience learns to turn away from a message if it's attention is not
arrested within a few seconds. As a result, the attention span of the
populace takes a historically unprecedented plunge, while the social
environment becomes filled with shocking people and shocking issues, which
do not necessarily have anything to do with real values or problems.
Perceptual shocks satisfy consumers by tickling their natural senses, and
reinforce the dominance of perception manipulators over value creators in
both political and economic decision-making bodies. Oftentimes, these
bodies are called to &quot;handle&quot; the photogenic non-issues they themselves
made up in the minds of the populace. John Perry Barlow once called this
&quot;government by the hallucinating mob&quot;. At this point it does not look like
changing the situation is perceived by anybody as being in their interest.
I would not try to convince you that ACF or any other technology can be a
social panacea, but it still may help fix some of the problems created by
the previous generation of communication tools - the mass media. The
consumers may soon learn that expensive TV ads may be fun to watch, but
modestly looking recommendations from their friends and independent experts
delivered by the ACF system promise more relevant products of better
quality and at a lower price - and they are actually worth attentively
watching all the way through. This may start some far-reaching trends.
</P>

<P>The society that does not have the benefit of enlightened visionary
governance, is prone to be corrupted by unexpected side-effects of
technological innovations (such as mass media) whose negative influences it
is not intelligent enough to counter. By the same token though, this
society also does not have the strength to resist when the arrow of the
technological imperative turns in the positive direction. So, unlike a
socium controlled by visionary villains, our situation at least has a
chance to be improved by dumb luck...</P>

<H3>Bringing new things to life</H3>

<P>So far, we discussed using people's opinions on existing things.
However, people can as easily express their opinions on the things they
want to bring into existence, or things they hope will never happen. They
can tell how much they want to have a concert next Tuesday night, whether
they think they need a bus service in their neighborhood, whether a
translation of some book into their language is desirable, or whether they
would join a mailing list on cactus collecting if it existed - and also how
much resources (time, money or other projects) they would sacrifice to make
sure this project is implemented (or prevented) and who they would trust to
perform the work. If there is a social agreement, the project would start.
The role of ACF in this process would be distribution of the initial
suggestions to people who care about them, and collection of opinions about
the utility of each suggestion and the best ways to implement it.
Meaningful targeting of all messages would assure that the suggestions
would be distributed only to people who do want to take part in the
project, so the expense of time would be minimal. Actually, not all
interested people have to take part. Each person can define trust quorum
criteria - for example, any 5 of his personal friends, or at least 20% of
the community, or any group whose total reputation exceeds a certain
threshold - and delegate them the right to commit his personal resources to
the project on his behalf (maybe, with certain limitations). The outcome
here is a variable-geometry representation and voting scheme in which
nobody's resources are committed without their personal approval, and the
most appropriate people, according to the best knowledge of the community,
are trusted with evaluating the decisions and carrying out the projects.
Comparisons of this scheme in efficiency with existing methods of
collecting and allocating public resources may be left as an exercise to
the reader. An interesting question is whether today's methods of
extraction of resources from unwilling &quot;participants&quot; and delegation of
power to &quot;representatives&quot; untrusted by many, may still appear efficient
for <EM>any</EM> purpose. An ideal construction of any social mechanism, in
my opinion, is one that combines the benefits of large-scale integration
with maximal local and personal freedoms. After a certain stage of
development of economy and communication industry, people started enjoying
such mechanisms in their economic life; maybe, ACF will be the technology
that will have the same effect on the political system and other
decision-making processes.</P>

<H3>ACF-based personalized representation of information</H3>

<P>Filtering the world for your attention is important, but it results in
just simple decisions, whether or not you should see a given item. After
that decision is made, lots of options remain in constructing your
interaction with an object. Presentation of information can be adjusted in
a variety of ways, based on what the ACF system learns from the behavior of
other people. Texts you see on the screen can be shown to you with the
parts that you are likely to be most interested in, highlighted, and
uninteresting details shrunk or masked. Terms that you are not likely to
understand may be converted to hyperlinks leading to explanations
appropriate for your level of expertise and linguistic and cultural
preferences. Similar transformations may be applied to sounds, images and
any other interface parts you may encounter, based on the experience the
system has gained from interacting with similar people. (More radical ideas
on possible transformations of one's view of the world and artificially
enhanced perception are described in my essay on Intelligent Information
Filters and Enhanced Reality.)</P>

<H3>Real-time memetic engineering</H3>

<P>The computational features of the knowledge economy will be based on
many heuristic parameters that can be continuously adjusted for various
purposes. Slight changes in computation factors can temporarily move access
traffic away from congested communication lines, change the balance between
stability and serendipity of information searches, shift advice on
entertainment choices toward healthier activities at the time of a flu
epidemic, support inter-group communications or increase attention to
third-party interests in periods of social instability, or steer students
towards the choice of subjects that are likely to become understaffed in
the near future. Of course, there are more direct methods of interference,
such as censoring message traffic or forcing selected connections. Any
private party could also help adjust the workings of the system, for
example, by subsidizing prices that certain people have to pay for certain
references (e.g., teenagers - for reading advice, or abuse victims - for
counseling references). The US government has one parameter now - the prime
rate - that it can more or less frequently modify to assure stability of
the market, and some other legal instruments - like taxes and tariffs - to
periodically readjust things. The information market can be fine-tuned in
real time (many times a second if it is necessary) along numerous
structural parameters. This creates wide opportunities for flexible and
intelligent regulation. And tremendous opportunities for abuse... A system
designed in the interests of the society as a whole should facilitate good
influences and prevent bad ones. For that, it should be very carefully
constructed.</P>

<H2>Future of ACF technology</H2>

<P>The applications mentioned above move beyond mere information filtering.
Further extensions of this technology may include other methods of
manipulating and utilizing semantic assessments of items and their features
by multiple human and machine participants of the system. For better
understanding of the item and user spaces and resolution of ambiguities in
user-item encounters where several interests of the user interact with
multiple features of the item, we may want to cluster item features and
user interests into functional vectors in the semantic space.
(Visualization tools and graphical navigation utilities in this space may
appear useful). The affinity factors of both items and users to these
&quot;semantic eigenvectors&quot; may provide compact and meaningful representations
of their essential features and assure more efficient communication of
their meaning. Such &quot;semantic encoding&quot; of information about entities
represented in the system may allow both dramatic improvements in
information flows and significant reduction in bandwidth requirements. The
representations can range from simple aggregate value assessments to
arbitrarily complex structured descriptions of people, objects, and their
relations. The exchange and usage of this high-level information may be
regulated by &quot;semantic communication protocols&quot;. Possible uses of this
technology are virtually unlimited. Terms such as &quot;Filtering systems&quot;,
&quot;Recommender systems&quot;, and &quot;Semantic transport&quot; describe just some of the
particular applications in the large emerging field of distributed
knowledge processing.</P>

<P>Building the semantic transport system on the planetary scale may appear
the most complex project ever undertaken in human history, with the
greatest impact on social structures and with numerous technological
challenges and social controversies on all levels. As we know from
experience with economic and political structures, it is extremely
important to build a proper architectural foundation that would assure
efficiency and stability of an emerging social mechanism.</P>
