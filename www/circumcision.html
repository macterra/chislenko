<STRONG>The correct URL for the circumcision page is
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/refs/circumcision.html">
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/refs/circumcision.html</A>
<BR>
(Notice 'refs' in the URL). Please adjust your links!
<P>
I would also greatly appreciate it if you report to the maintainer
of the page where you found this link, and me, about this,
as I want to make sure that other people do not get lost when this
notice goes away.
<P>
Thanks a lot - and sorry for the inconvenience  - Alexander Chislenko </STRONG>
