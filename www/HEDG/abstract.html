<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Symbolic communication mechanisms played a crucial role in the social
evolution by allowing animals and humans to exchange personal experiences
and thus turning collections of relatively isolated organisms into adaptive
distributed cognition systems. Introduction of money as abstract symbolic
representation of value allowed efficient distribution of economic
information in the society. By providing aggregate information on the
comparative values of goods and services to participants with bounded
interests and rationality, the economic signaling mechanisms give them
incentives to adjust their consumption and production efforts in
accordance with the collective requirements of all other agents in the
system. This allowed the complexity of the value exchange system to
increase by orders of magnitude, while improving its adaptability.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  With still greater complexity and scale of the system, it becomes
crucially important to assure that the agents focus on the right tasks,
form reasonable expectations of the utility of various goods and services,
and set up stable and mutually beneficial relationships with each other.
These focusing and utility assessment mechanisms were originally provided
by individual experiences and unmediated sharing of knowledge, similar to
value exchange mechanisms before the appearance of money. Later, there
appeared more complex situational regulatory instruments, such as
enterprise shares, securities, voting rights, and access privileges - and
then symbolic aggregate knowledge, such as popularity ratings, publications
of industry trends and statistics and sample contract arrangements that
have been observed to be efficient in prototypical situations. Further
progress of signaling instruments depends on availability of standardized
semantic descriptions of quality and utility of various resources, needs
and abilities of different agents. It also requires efficient methods of
data acquisition, aggregation and analysis, and low-cost communication and
processing tools.  All these parts are now coming into place.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We are developing a simple prototype of such a "hyper-economic" system,
combining flows of globally aggregated scalar information on prices with
mechanisms for sharing knowledge about situational utilities of classes of
products. The project suggests a conceptual framework for mixing value and
utility signaling mechanisms, and non-scalar analogs of
derivative financial instruments. Introduction of explicit knowledge
sharing mechanisms is expected to allows the system to scale to greater
levels of complexity and volatility than the economic system can do alone.
This approach allows us to model the interaction of formal economic markets
with information sharing mechanisms crucial for the modern economy, and
introduces new regulatory tools that may improve the efficiency and
adaptability of existing economic systems. It also permits building
automated information economies which do not have the benefit of non-formal
knowledge transfers.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The model explores the dynamics of a hyper-economic regulatory system in
the case of simple situational utility knowledge, and allows to compare the
performance of the extended signaling mechanisms to that of conventional
economic communication among system agents, and to centralized regulation.
The first practical implementation is aimed at optimizing the users'
browsing experience on the Web, as this domain offers a large amount of
experimental data, and allows to quantitatively assess the utility of the
model. Plans for the extension of the model include rewards to agents
for globally useful exploratory behavior, partial disclosure of experience,
ownership of situational knowledge, replication of agents and informational
and financial relations with the offspring. This approach may also help
optimize knowledge transfers in distributed AI systems by comparing expected
utilities and costs of computational services.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The new signaling instruments are aimed to aid individual agents in
optimizing their behavior by using available knowledge for assessing
expected personal costs, risks, and utilities. At the same time, more
complex signaling tools and automated semantic transports may allow the
whole system to progress to higher levels of complexity, efficiency, and
adaptability, and develop explicit global cognitive mechanisms, forming
rudimentary reflective consciousness and self-awareness of the system.
