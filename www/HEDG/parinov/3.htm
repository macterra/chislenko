Spatial boundaries of information interactions between agents</b></font></a></p>

<p>One of outputs of previous section is a statement that the
system space is divided into the zones of strong, medium, and
weak interactions between the agents of the system. It's resulted
from consideration of devaluation process of information flows
content during the time of their propagation through the economic
system space shown in the abstract picture above. </p>

<p>For the clearness of the further discussion, let us introduce
the notion of “observer” (it was &quot;agent-source&quot;
above) who can be any given agent of economic system located in a
certain point of its information space. This will enable us to
define the differentiation between the possible interactions of
each individual agent of the system (“the observer”) with all
the rest of the agents. (We use the concept of the “observer”
approximately in the same manner as it done in the physical
Relativistic Theory by Albert Einstein). It is necessary to
stress that differentiation of agent subsets considered below
belonging to certain information space zones should be
interpreted as a phenomenon being purely relative for the
observer selected. One and the same part of economic system can
be the zone of different types of interactions depending on which
agent is under consideration.</p>

<p>Now, if the observer is located in a certain point of
information space, his interactions with other agents of the
system can be divided into “strong”, “medium” and
“weak”. </p>

<p>The zone of information space in the vicinity of the observer
can be considered as that of strong interactions if his
information exchange with the most remote agents of this zone
(positioned at its boundary) takes time that does not exceed the
period during which essential changes in the system occur. Let
the border of this zone be distant from the observer location
point by the length of radius <i>Ro</i> (see Fig. 3 below). Thus,
strong interactions are possible between closely positioned
agents that have the opportunity of information exchange in the
so-called real time mode; the subset of those agents is located
inside the zone with radius <i>Ro</i>.</p>

<p>Among the agents, located at the distance more than <i>Ro</i>
from the observer, there is a subset for which information
exchange with the observer can implement their interactions
provided that information flows from the source agent do not
presuppose considerable feedback from the recipient agent. This
case is characterized by primarily unilateral information flows;
this makes it possible to increase the number of agents (compared
to the group of “strong interactions”) with whom the observer
can interact but has to sacrifice the feedback reactions to the
signals received. Let us consider that this group of agents is in
the zone of medium interactions relative to the observer. The
outermost boundary of this zone is equal to the time interval of
the direct travel of information flows to the point where the
information substantially loses its actuality. Let this boundary
be distant from the observer location by radius <i>Re</i>. If we
assume the velocity continuity of direct and backward travel of
information flows, <i>Re</i> should be approximately twice as
long as radius <i>Ro</i>.</p>

<p>All those not included in the previous groups, and thus
positioned at the distance longer than <i>Re</i> relative to the
observer, are in the zone of weak interactions with the observer.
No one from this third group of agents can have information
exchange with the observer in the real time mode. During the time
necessary for information flows to travel from the observer to
any point in the zone of weak interactions, the content of
information flows fails to be adequate to the current state of
the economic system due to unexpected changes accumulated during
this period. Therefore, information flows in this case cannot be
the basis for full-fledged interactions; however, there are
situations when, even under such circumstances, certain types of
interactions do take place.</p>

        technical limitations on information propagation velocity
        in a stochastic environment, interactions between economy
        participants have certain spatial structure which, in the
        first approximation, we characterized as zones of strong
        (<i>A</i>), medium (<i>B</i>), and weak (<i>C</i>)
        interactions. Interaction intensity in each of the above
        zones, naturally, can vary from zero to the upper
        possible limit for the given zone. So, all other
        intensities can be actually implemented in the zone of
        strong interactions. All the intensities can be
        implemented in the medium interaction zone except for the
        “strong intensity”, etc. </font></td>

<p>Analogies can be easily drawn between the three levels of
interaction intensity with the main types of institutional
structures. Strong interactions are characteristic of &quot;small
groups&quot; and tribes (according <a href="refer.htm#D. North">D.
North</a>, 1997 it is &quot;personified links without
control&quot;); their participants can exchange information in
real time. Medium interactions having mostly unilateral nature,
are characteristic of hierarchy structures (<a
href="refer.htm#D. North">D. North</a>, 1997: &quot;non- and
personified links with control&quot;) where information flows go
primarily from superiors to subordinates (from principal to
agent). Weak interactions (<a href="refer.htm#D. North">D. North</a>,
1997: &quot;non-personified links without any control&quot;)
correspond to market interactions. </p>

<p>As it was mentioned before, all the other institutional
structures can work in the environment that exists in a small
group. On the contrary, no other institutional structure than the
market one, can function in the global market environment.</p>
