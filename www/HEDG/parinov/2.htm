Theoretical limits of information interactions in economic space</b></font></a></p>

<p>In virtual space of Internet technologies being the base
environment for the performance of network economy, human
interactions are exercised as follows: </p>

<p>1) via dissemination of information flows over space; </p>

<p>2) in the form of collection and processing of information;
and </p>

<p>3) via direct information exchange between economy
participants. </p>

<p>All these processes are implemented with the help of
information and communications technologies being the technical
means of interactions. Interaction carriers are information flows
disseminating in the information environment of economic system.
We will call the &quot;information environment of economic
system&quot; as an &quot;information space&quot;.</p>

<p>Let us consider how technical limitations on dissemination of
information flows combined with the factor of gradual
obsolescence of information will influence the structure of
interactions of an individual agent with the rest of agents in
economic system.</p>

<p>Information flows are disseminated over economic system with
certain finite velocity. Upper limit of the latter depends on the
current development level of ICT. Even if each given pair of
agents can be connected with the fastest of existing information
exchange channels, it is practically impossible to simultaneously
ensure similar conditions for all the agents of economic system.
Thus, from the viewpoint of each individual agent, there always
will be groups of agents with whom there is an opportunity of
fast information exchange as well as other groups with no such
opportunity. </p>

<p>From theoretical point of view, the situation could be
presented as follows: </p>

<p>1. Agents geographically distributed over the space of
economic system have a certain network of information exchange
channels. Information flows created by agents disseminated over
the entire system via this network and gradually fade away.
Development of information exchange channel topology can produce
situations when individual agents have better conditions for
interactions with remote agents then with immediate neighbors.
Therefore, proximity or remoteness of agents in virtual
information space, in a general case, can differ from the similar
geographical parameters.</p>

<p>2. For the time being, we exclude from consideration the
parameters of geographical distribution of agents in the system
and the technique of transforming geographical distances into
information ones. Let us limit our analysis to the boundaries of
virtual space. We shall proceed from the notion that all the
multitude of agents is distributed in a certain fashion over the
virtual (information) space of economic system. The distance in
information space is defined as follows: the farther are the
agents from each other, the more time is required for an
information flow sent by one of them to reach the other. </p>

<p>3. Select a certain individual agent as the center from which
information flows are emanated. The distance from the center to
the rest of the agents in information space could be
characterized by the time interval required for reception of
information flows by each economic system agent (within this
interval information travels from the source agent to the
recipient). Thus, we are able to obtain a set of values of
information remoteness of system agents from the “center”
selected; in conjunction with particular points in space those
values make it possible to define its topology.</p>

<p>It should be noted that within an economic system there is
also a continuous flow of stochastic changes of its state that,
in the general case, cannot be predicted by the agents. In our
case this results in the fact that information flows
disseminating over the system, gradually lose their adequacy to
the current state of the system and therefore decrease in value.
Usual situation: information sent by the source agent cannot be
altered on the way to the addressee. During the time of
information travel, the system can undergo changes that lead to
the loss of actuality by information content. </p>

<p>Thus, such parameter as the intensity of stochastic changes
within an economic system under constant information
dissemination velocity defines the maximum possible duration of
information dissemination. Exceeding this duration means loss of
topicality of the given information. We have to keep in mind that
the full-fledged agent interaction should presuppose mutual
information exchange (recipient forms and relays back to the
source its reaction to the information flow received).
Consequently, the time interval of the maximum possible duration
should incorporate also the reception of feedback by the agent
source. </p>

        interactions between agents depend on: a)remoteness of

        b)average velocity of information dissemination through

        Let agent-source knows current state of agents-recipient
        (it's upper line connected all agents). He can forecast
        states of agents-recipient (forecasted states located on
        the information flow line). Agent-source starts
        information flow to agent-recipient (blue and light blue
        arrows). Radial arrows show where should be future state
        of agents-recipient while information flow is
        disseminating. The flow content based on a forecast of
        the state of agents-recipient that agent-source could
        make. But to the moment when agents-recipient will
        receive an information from agent-source unpredictable
        changes make uncertain the real state of agent-recipient.
        The probability to shot the real state is lesser then
        farther agent-recipient from agent-source.</td>

    <li>Agents-recipient located inside zone <i>A</i> have the
        best conditions to interact with agent-source. They are
        closed enough to the agent-source to receive and send

        Agents-recipients from here can receive actual picture
        from the agent-source, but they are too far for real time
