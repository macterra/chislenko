General picture of economic system functioning through
information interactions</b></font></a></p>

<p>It was concluded above that institutional frameworks shield
the corresponding sub-space from the excessive mutability of the
objects in real environment, filter information flows and set the
space-forming rules common for all the participants. If the agent
activity is localized mainly within the above limitations, he can
have a wrong impression that this is the true reality. In
principle, the differences between a sub-space and reality (e.g.,
degree of slow downing the real changes in it) can be noticed and
assessed only by an outsider observer (here there are
associations with specific features of observer perception of the
worlds in the relativism theory from physics).</p>

<p>The sub-spaces created by institutional structures can be
ordered according to the multiplicity principle. Multiplicity of
sub-spaces is explained by the fact that each new subspace is
created as a means of forming the conditions for interactions
that are technically impossible in the current sub-space. As
mentioned above, there is a &quot;natural&quot; space for agent
interaction corresponding to the internal environment of a small
group. It would be logical to start from this natural space the
examination of the necessity of creating the sub-spaces and their
multiplicity. It was previously noted that it could be divided
into 3 zones: 1)strong; 2)medium; and 3)weak interactions. The
natural space is the first zone (strong interactions).</p>

<p>In the first zone, information exchange intensity for
coordination of changes in the state of the participants of joint
activity is kept within the current technical limitations on
information exchange. Owing to this, agent can maintain the
collective model of the environment in the actual state and
rehearse possible variants of joint activity. The collective
model of environment in this case coincides with the model of
each individual participant in the first zone. By definition,
group of agents located in the first zone does not need to create
additional subspaces to interact between themselves.</p>

<p>Outside of the first zone agents can not build the real time
collective model. Collective model of the environment for a
certain agents group can form when the agent interaction
intensity inside this group is not lower than intensity of the
changes in the state of agents themselves. The conditions for
existence of the collective model of environment in general looks
as follows: </p>

<p>a) Each agent has a certain set of his own information images
related with a set of institutional structures. These images have
different quality of the picture of agent's capabilities and
intentions. The images create a set of channels for agent
interactions.</p>

<p>b) The set of private mono-quality information images belonged
to the same institutional structure can be transformed into a
collective model of the environment for the given group of
agents. But only if the possible information exchange intensity
between those agents is higher than the intensity of changing by
the agents of their information images of the given quality.</p>

<p>In the second zone, technical limitations on information
exchange make possible the interactions that are based on mainly
unilateral information exchange, and, as a consequence, equal
coordination of joint activity is already impossible. In this
case, the agents positioned in the second zone relative to the
observer receive from him the ready-to-use model of the
environment (it could be, for instance, designed by the observer
himself or by a group of agents from the first zone). Thus, for
some agents the environment model coincides with their individual
models (this agents group represents management); for another
group their own models are defined by the “directives” and,
therefore, correspond to certain fragments of the environment. In
such situation, the capabilities of “subordinates” are
underused; under certain circumstances, however, this can be
compensated by substantial economic benefits owing to higher
specialization of the participants of the given joint activity.
Interaction participants in the second zone can have significant
gains from the joint activity even without the introduction of
additional sub-space. However, there is a reserve in their
interactions related to the underused capabilities of a portion
of participants; this represents a certain incentive for
searching for the acceptable compromise between the three
components:</p>

<p>1) costs of creation and maintenance of a sub-space that
enables equal interactions between all the participants of the
joint activity; </p>

<p>2) gains from the equal position of all the participants in
the formation of environment model and coordination of their
activity;</p>

<p>3) losses related to the inevitable partial inadequacy of the
sub-space to the real processes of changes in the economic
system. </p>

<p>Under certain conditions (e.g., with specialized education and
training of managers, and under weak mutability and
“standardization” of capabilities and intentions of the
subordinates), a group of managers can create and maintain a
model of environment that will be close to the best of the
possible variants without introduction of a special sub-space.
Thus, incentives of agents from 2<sup>nd</sup> zone for creation
of new interaction subspaces theoretically exist, but they can
happen to be insufficiently strong.</p>

<p>In the third zone, direct information exchange and,
consequently, direct coordination of the agent joint activity,
are not possible. Stochastic changes in the state of all the
objects of economic system devalue information flows by the
moment when they reach the border of zone three. Thus,
particularly to organize the interaction between the observer and
the agents located in zone three, it is necessary to establish a
special sub-space. This is an artificial (compare with the
&quot;natural&quot; space of interactions) sub-space created by
an institutional structure. Functionally it is a projection of
real space onto another, less mutable &quot;coordinate
axes&quot;. Therefore, the above sub-space can be considered as
the first level of a hierarchy of the real space projections.</p>

<p>In the general case, it can happen that the first projection
does not provide the agents with all the necessary prerequisites
for interaction. Suppose that economic system has sufficiently
large scale. Then the observer positioned in a certain point of
the first sub-space has three zones of interaction (<i>A'</i>, <i>B'</i>
and <i>C'</i>). Their meaning is identical to the described above
zones <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. If the border of the third
zone in the first sub-space is distant from the economic system
boundaries, the agents have to construct institutional framework
in order to create a projection of the second level. It is clear
that this situation can be repeated to substantiate the necessity
of the third sub-space, and so on.</p>

<p>Thus, the number of sub-spaces required for the agents to
organize interactions between themselves within the framework of
the entire economic system, depends on the following parameters:</p>

<p>1) the scale and scope of economic system;</p>

<p>2) ICT development level that ensures a certain degree of
information exchange;</p>

<p>3) mutability extent of the objects in the system.</p>
