Scheme of Information Interactions: Causes and Motives of
Interactions</b></font></a></p>

<p>The habitat defines basic configuration, parameters, and
motives for agent interactions. Material world created in the
preceding period of the economic system existence defines
physical limits, provides the means and carriers for
dissemination of signals and interactions. All these combined do
form interaction opportunities. The structure and character of
stimulating motives for economic activity of the agents formed in
this world, defines which interaction topologies are
realistically necessary and which of them will be further
implemented.</p>

<p>We consider agent economic activity in its developed form. In
this case it is based on a certain labor division
(specialization) between agents in an economic system and implies
collective use of a certain set of related technologies in the
production process (let us call this set a macro-technology). We
understand a macro-technology as a production apparatus created
within an economic system; its individual elements are adapted to
the existing labor division system and they form the “jobs”
for the agents. At the “input” to macro-technology are
natural resources. Material products for final consumption are
located at the “output”. The structure and composition of a
macro-technology, in the general case, is not a distinctly
specified set. Its &quot;job&quot; items could be excessive,
duplicating, etc. We cannot also exclude simultaneous existence
of several macro-technology types that can be employed by the
system both in parallel and on the alternative basis.</p>

<p>Macro-technology elements, similar to agents, are distributed
in a certain fashion around the economic system space and can
change their spatial location under certain circumstances. As a
result of certain procedures (to be described below), agents take
the “jobs” of the macro-technology and make it work: they
implement the production process characteristic of the given
macro-technology. The latter is a material foundation for the
agent community to solve the problems of their socioeconomic
existence and development. The structure and parameters of its
jobs, as a rule, are more stable than the structure of agent
possibilities and states. In a short-term aspect, agent community
solves the problem of optimal allocation of agents for the given
set of macro-technology jobs; it is oriented at individual
differences in agent productivity relative to the set of jobs. In
the long-term aspect, agent community improves the
macro-technology and solves the problem of adapting agent
capacities to its newly acquired characteristics.</p>

<p>In the process of macro-technology using the technological
links appear and specific interactions do happen between agents.
The links determine whom from does an individual agent receive
the intermediate product of production process and who he
transfers it to after completing its portion of this product
transformation.</p>

<p>Technological network of links would have no economic sense if
it would not be completed by distribution feedbacks that provide
for dissemination and distribution of the final product among the
agents of the economic system. Thus, agents create and maintain
among themselves another network of relationships that, in a
general case, can happen not to coincide with topology of
technological link network. Agent’s place in distribution
network is defined by whom from he receives a certain portion of
the final product and who he further transfers it to less what he
can leave for himself to maintain his life activity necessities.</p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%">Having found his place in
        the system of technological links (a sub-space on the
        left side on Fig. 5) and distribution (a sub-space at the
        bottom on Fig. 5), the agent somewhat positions himself
        relative to the rest of the agents also involved with the
        above relationships. Those who he interacts with via
        direct links, are his closest neighbors in the given
        sub-spaces. The longer the chain of links between two
        given agents, the longer the distance between them,
        although geographically they can be located quite close
        to each other.</td>

<p>Apart from the activity mediated by the above relationship
networks there is one more type. Before put themselves into
technological and distribution networks agents search for the
better place within those networks as well as coordinate their
interests and capacities with each other. New kind of agent
activity, as opposed to aforeconsidered, is not directly related
to exchange of material substances. Its content is information
exchange; it has the form of purely informational agent
interaction.</p>

<p><a href="refer.htm#David Leevers">David Leveers</a> proposed
some structurization of motives and causes of information
exchanges between economy participants in the form of a
“cognition cycle”. It makes a stress on the existence of
various stages of information preparation and exchange between
economy participants. Moves from stage to stage are exercised as
a gradual transition from one type of agents' communication to
another. In the networked economy this means the transition from
one telecommunications service to another. </p>

<p>In metaphoric concepts that are essentially based on the
contemporary capacities of the Internet technologies, cognition
cycle has the following stages:</p>

<p>1. &quot;Territory&quot;. Private &quot;territory&quot; for
individual actions (here we recollect what we had just learned,
adjust our existing mental model of the world in accord with the
latest changes, rehearse the application of new skills and ideas,
start formulating what we would like to do further, etc.).</p>

<p>2. &quot;Map&quot;. Is used for initial orientation and
navigation. When we dare to leave our private “territory”, we
need a ‘map” which is a passive information in the form of
references (newspapers, books, Yellow Pages, etc.).</p>

<p>3. &quot;Landscape”. Designed for other people and is a
result of our intercourse as individuals, shows us how are we
linked to communities and groups around us. “Landscape” can
be a real space such as a staff meeting at the office or a
construction site where actions are visible, and intercourse is
audible.</p>

<p>4. &quot;Room&quot;. Is designed for meetings between
individuals to conduct negotiations, brainstorming, and
establishment of the base for future communication and
cooperation.</p>

<p>5. &quot;Table&quot; Space for joint work on an agreement over
individual provisions, problems and situations that require a
planned cooperative approach.</p>

<p>6. &quot;Theater&quot;. The space in which the results of
joint activity become visible and socially available. </p>

<p>The intensity of human interactions at various stages of this
cycle is quite different. At the first stage (see the above list)
– “territory” – the needs in communication and
information exchange are at the minimum. Then they reach the
maximum at the “table” stage and somewhat decrease by the
concluding stage of the cycle (“theater”). </p>

<p>Apparently, in the process of the above stages the
participants solve the task of finding mutually acceptable
variants of positioning themselves in the network of production
and distribution relationships as well as bringing the optimal
variants found to practical use.</p>
