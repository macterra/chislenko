Institutional Picture of Economic Interactions</b></font></a></p>

<p>Some parts of economic discipline have different points of
view on what are interactions between economic objects and
describe those by different kind of economic models (<a
href="refer.htm#Alan Kirman">Alan Kirman</a>). Below we will base
on a picture of economic interactions accepted from New
Institutional Economics approach. From the point of view of
institutional economics, rules of behavior in a society or “to
be more formal, the limitations created by man that organize
interactions between human beings” (<a
href="refer.htm#D. North">D. North</a> , 1997, p.17), are society
institutions. Those institutions set the pattern of stimulating
motives and include various limitations, created by man in order
to shape up human interactions (<a href="refer.htm#D. North">D.
North</a>, 1997, p. 18). Following this concept, we shall
differentiate between, on the one hand, the institutions that
form the opportunities for society members and acting as
“limitations within which people interact with each other”,
on the other hand – organizations that use those opportunities
and “similar to institutions, structure the interaction between
people (<a href="refer.htm#D. North">D. North</a>, 1997, p. 19,
23).</p>

<p>Certain types of activity exist in the society that raise
institutions as economic reality and maintain their efficiency.
In this respect, specific human activity aimed at maintaining the
performance of institutions can be presented as a certain
mechanism that provides for interactions between organizations
and individuals. At the “entrance” to this mechanism are
economy participants in a free, unorganized state. At the
“exit” – the same agents but connected via a system of
established short- and long-term relationships. Thus,
institutions and activity that supports them transfer a set of
economic agents from free, “chaotic” state into a certain
ordered institutional pattern (organization consisting of the
above agents and relationships between them). Here, some types of
relationships and corresponding organizations exist for quite a
short period of time (e.g., acts of exchange at the market),
other live for much longer periods (e.g., firms and
corporations). We shall call this process as the action of
“institutional mechanism” meaning that within internal
environment of an organization a other mechanism is working that
manages organization itself.</p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="55%"><font size="2">It is
        possible to depict the general institutional
        cross-section of economic world. At each given point in
        time the entire set of agents is broken down into 2
        groups: 1) agents in free, “chaotic” state; 2) agents
        being in the bound state in the form of a set of
        organizations. Several types of institutional mechanisms
        are working in the economic system space that
        continuously transfer the multitude of free agents into a
        multitude of organizations (bound state). Due to certain
        reasons, relationships established between agents in the
        form of organizations, are regularly exhausted (they fail
        to correspond to objectives for the sake of which those
        relationships had been established). After that
        relationships are broken and agents resume to the free
        state. Thus, work cycles of the mechanisms are repeated
        time and again. </font></td>

<p>Human interactions are mediated by their habitat in society;
to a large extent it is established as the result of employing
the technologies accumulated by the society. Maturity of
technologies, particularly their information and communication
constituents, is determined (in addition to institutional
limitations) by one more – purely technical – type of
limitations on human interactions within society. Similar as
institutions set opportunities those are further used by
organizations, information-communications technologies (ICT)
determine the average level of information interactions (doing by
information exchange) in a society and set their possible
ceiling. Institutions structure interactions of the people within
the framework of those technical limitations. The question is how
we can describe the institution mechanism as information
interactions between agents.</p>
