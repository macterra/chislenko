Economy as a complex system of agents with information

<p>In all cases before we understood the term &quot;agent&quot;
as a human who is an actor of social processes. Now we should
make the sense of the term a little wider because we are going to
rewrite our scheme of information interactions under the
&quot;agent-based computational economics&quot; method (<a
href="refer.htm#Leigh Tesfatsion">Leigh Tesfatsion</a>; <a
href="refer.htm#Philip E. Agre">Philip E. Agre</a>). </p>

<p>According contents of previous sections we will describe
&quot;interactions of autonomous agents channeled through
socio-economic institutions&quot; (<a
href="refer.htm#Leigh Tesfatsion">Leigh Tesfatsion</a>) where
types of agents include following:</p>

<p>1) Macro-technology;</p>

<p>2) Information space;</p>

<p>3) Institutional structure;</p>

<p>4) Collective information model of environment;</p>

<p>5) Human participant of interactions (he is an
&quot;agent&quot; in narrow sense of this term).</p>

<p>From our point of view each of these five agents has much or
less human component because they functioning realize through
certain human activity. So when we define five types of agents
here we distinguish some kind of specific human activity related
with each of the agents. </p>

<p>To be more precise in terms let the fifth type of agents
(&quot;human participant&quot;) will be called as a
&quot;sizer&quot;. The same name has some similar models of
self-replicated objects from mathematical genetics. See a survey
on &quot;self-replication&quot; topics in (<a
href="refer.htm#Moshe Sipper">Moshe Sipper</a>).</p>

<p>Summarize all above we can define the main functions and
features of selected five types of agents (&quot;what these
agents produce in the system&quot;). At the first step of
building an agent-based model of the complex socio-economic
system in the framework of our methodology we, of course, make
some simplifications: </p>

<p>1. &quot;Macro-technology&quot; agent produces a resource for
sizers' living. The quantity of the resource depends on
parameters of sizers' distribution over the set of jobs belonged
to the macro-technology. Sizers' optimizing behavior that looks
in our case as their wish to find the best distribution leads the
whole system of agents to an equilibrium state. In principal the
system can have several parallel macro-technology agents.</p>

<p>2. &quot;Information space&quot; agent produces for each sizer
in the system a perimeter of the zone of his environment where he
can recognize a sub-set of sizers for interactions (choice area).
The boundaries of the choice area depend on the ICT development
level and on the strength of changes in the system (including
sizers' states). So then more steady stable state sizers have
then in average their choice area is wider. This agent makes
local a sizer's searching of optimal distribution over the set of
jobs. In general the system has only one agent of this type. </p>

<p>3. &quot;Institutional structure&quot; agent produces a
sub-space for sizers interactions. Such sub-space defines rules
of sizers' information images building and makes a certain simple
projection of macro-technology set of jobs. By this way sizers
can get wider choice areas from the &quot;information space&quot;
agent and in result they have more chances to find their optimal
distribution over the set of jobs. The system can have several
agents of this type.</p>

<p>4. &quot;Collective information model&quot; agent produces the
best (and Pareto optimal) plan for changing current configuration
of sizers' distribution over the set of jobs. It works similar to
&quot;how agents are learning about other agents&quot; (<a
href="refer.htm#Jose M. Vidal, Edmund H. Durfee">Jose M. Vidal,
Edmund H. Durfee</a>). This agent appears for each group of
sizers those &quot;see&quot; each other in their choice areas.
The same picture takes place for each parallel sub-space created
by &quot;institutional structure&quot; agents. Sizers exchange
through the collective model by their suggestions on
re-configuration of current distribution over jobs. The best (by
output) suggestion registered in the collective model to the end
of time for sizers' &quot;discussions&quot; becomes a real
configuration of jobs distribution for the next production cycle.</p>

<p>5. &quot;Sizer&quot; agent produces the maximum of his output
by changing his place in the macro-technology chain. He can also
initiate the same changes for other sizers from his choice area.
His suggestions will produce the real growth of his output if it
approved by other sizers from his choice area (criterion is Pareto
optimum). He can choose different sub-spaces to
&quot;discuss&quot; with other sizers of the system how they can
get a better output. The system can have many agents of this
type.</p>

<p>General relations between these types of agents see at the
Fig. 8.</p>

<p>Green boxes on the Fig. 8 mean types of agents. Yellow boxes
– intermediate objects of the system that help to show
relations between agents. As one can see on the Fig.8 the central
element of the system is the &quot;collective information
model&quot; agent. A set of these agents provides the main
process of the system functioning (information interactions
between sizers) and reflects current states of macro-technology,
institutional structures and sizers themselves. The
&quot;information space&quot; agent specifies the precision of
this reflection and its boundaries. </p>

<p>More detailed working out of the model should be plunged into
a framework of the appropriate modeling method. It could be
