<p>What kind of information interactions among agents makes
possible a functioning of socio-economic systems? What theory do
we need to describe the fundamental principles of agents'
information interactions? What is the model to simulate
functioning of networked economy arisen in Information Society?
How we should organize artificial environments where our
&quot;intelligent information agents&quot; will interact with
each other to help us in our online communications inside
numerous human communities? The main purpose of this article is
to suggest answers on these questions. Following statements are
discussed in the article: </p>

<p>Rapid development of Information Society and its Networked
Economy attracts attention to the role of information
interactions in functioning of social systems. Information
interactions are the more fundamental level to describe a
functioning of a social and economic system then market or
hierarchical interactions. Central element of agents' information
interactions is &quot;collective information model&quot; of their
environment. There are some limits on information interactions
related with parameters of economic system. Institutional
structures are able to channel information interactions beyond
the limits. Market and hierarchical interactions are just special
cases of such channels. Simplest model of economic system
functioning with information interactions includes five types of
objects (macro-technology, information space, institutional
structures, collective information models, and human actors).</p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974709"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Introduction</b></font></a></p>

<p>What kind of information interactions among agents makes
possible a functioning of socio-economic systems? What theory do
we need to describe the fundamental principles of agents'
information interactions? What is the model to simulate
functioning of networked economy arisen in Information Society?
How we should organize artificial environments where our
&quot;intelligent information agents&quot; will interact with
each other to help us in our online communications inside
numerous human communities? </p>

<p>The main purpose of this article is to suggest answers on
these questions. Practically we need to learn the basic
principles of organizing of information interactions in real
networked forms of organization and in artificial systems like
community of negotiated and collaborated information robots,
software agents and so on. It is important for better realization
of at least two tasks of modern social progress: a)Development of
Information Society and its &quot;networked economy&quot; for
higher living conditions; b)Development of the Internet
technologies for more efficient cooperative work. </p>

<p>There are a lot of publications discussed modern changes in an
economy related with Internet technology development. The modern
(or near future) state of economy has several names: &quot;New
Economy&quot; (<a href="refer.htm#Stephen B. Shepard">Stephen B.
Shepard</a>), &quot;Next Economy&quot; (<a
href="refer.htm#J. Bradford De Long, A. Michael Froomkin">J.
Bradford De Long, A. Michael Froomkin</a>), &quot;Hi-Tech Gift
Economy&quot; (<a href="refer.htm#Richard Barbrook">Richard
Barbrook</a>), &quot;Attention Economy&quot; (<a
href="refer.htm#Michael H. Goldhaber">Michael H. Goldhaber</a>),
&quot;Network Economy&quot; (<a href="refer.htm#Kevin Kelly">Kevin
Kelly</a>), and at last &quot;Networked Economy&quot; (see <a
href="refer.htm#Status Report">Status Report on European Telework</a>).
There is also a whole &quot;<a href="refer.htm#Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia
of the New Economy</a>&quot; (<a
href="http://www.hotwired.com/special/ene/">http://www.hotwired.com/special/ene/</a>).
One of the most interesting features of these modern changes is
that people get a principally new global environment for their
interactions. So now actors can actually move their social,
economic and so on interactions to the new environment, but
social scientists know very few about mechanisms of interactions
in socio-economic systems (<a href="refer.htm#Alan Kirman">Alan
Kirman</a>). </p>

<p>The problem is that research of socio-economic interactions
based on market or hierarchical models of the system and so the
human interactions look like commodity exchanges or
principal-agent relations (<a href="refer.htm#S. Parinov">S.
Parinov</a>). What about a picture of the economy based on pure
information interactions? </p>

<p>In this article we propose a theoretical concept and a
skeleton of agent-based model of economic system functioning with
information interactions between agents. This concept could be
useful not only in better understanding of Information Society
and its networked economy development, but also for designing of
artificial systems of interactive entities living into Internet
technology environment. Such artificial systems, for example, are
the next step of moving recent business infrastructure to the
&quot;e-business&quot; (<a
href="refer.htm#Business and the Internet Survey">Business and
the Internet Survey</a>. The Economist, June 26<sup>th</sup>
1999) where some part of interactions business-to-business and
business-to-customer serves by information robots and software
agents (see as a sample <a
href="refer.htm#Arie Segev, Carrie Beam">Arie Segev, Carrie Beam</a>).</p>

<p>In the first section of the article we reinterpreted
institutional economics statements on interactions among economic
agents as a start point of our analysis. The second section
discusses theoretical limits on information interactions related
with level of ICT development and intensity of changes of an
economic system. Third section concludes that three types of
information interactions (strong, medium and weak) of single
agent with others exist and it could be roughly corresponded with
interactions in small group, hierarchical organization and in a
market. Fourth section shows how theoretical limits of
information interactions can be overcame by using of
institutional structures. In the fifth and sixth section propose
a scheme of information interactions between agents. Seventh
section shows an idea of general picture of economic system
functioning through information interactions between agents.
Eighth section makes a first step to a computer model of an
economic system based on our methodology. </p>
