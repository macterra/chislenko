<p>I suppose that following outcomes of this article should be
emphasized: </p>

<p>a) Rapid development of Information Society and its Networked
Economy attracts attention to the role of information
interactions in functioning of social systems. Information
interactions are the more fundamental level to describe a
functioning of a social and economic system then market or
hierarchical interactions. </p>

<p>b) Central element of agents' information interactions is
&quot;collective information model&quot; of their environment.
This element plays the key role in the organizational design for
the networked economy.</p>

<p>c) There are some limits on information interactions related
with parameters of economic system.</p>

<p>d) Institutional structures are able to channel information
interactions beyond the limits. Market and hierarchical
interactions are just special cases of such channels.</p>

<p>e) Simplest model of economic system functioning with
information interactions includes five types of objects
(macro-technology, information space, institutional structures,
collective information models, and human actors).</p>

<p>Now we are well prepared to make the second step to building
of the general model of the socio-economic system and learn its
features. The main target here is the general model of an economy
functioning combined descriptions of different economic
mechanisms (like market, hierachy, small group and other) under
common logical scheme. Research on &quot;how institutional
structures exist and work&quot; has the special interest in this
framework. It seems our concept can also help to get new
responses on questions like &quot;What is the role of
institutions and how are they related to the aggregated
performance of the socio-economic systems? What is the relation
between institutions and the behaviour of the agents?&quot; (<a

Caldas and Helder Coelho</a>).</p>

<p>Another research direction in using of this methodology is the
Agent-Based Social Simulation. This work should include
&quot;Methodologies and software engineering for agent
systems&quot; and &quot;Intelligent information agents&quot;
topics. Research task is designing of more efficient &quot;living
environment&quot; for information robots and software agents
served some kind of online communities (like e-commerce,
e-business, researchers networks, and so on).</p>
