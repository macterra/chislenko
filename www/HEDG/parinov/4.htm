General pattern of information interactions beyond theoretical
limits</b></font></a></p>

<p>When an agent interacts with someone other he receives and
keeps an information image of current partner's state.</p>

<p>Interaction between the observer and a certain given agent is
possible in principle when the information image of this agent
corresponds to his real state with sufficient accuracy. Two-way
interaction between observer and given agent is possible when
both information images can be maintaining correctly. If
information image reproduces the state of the corresponding agent
inaccurately, the possibility that this pair of agents will find
a mutually acceptable variant of their joint activity based on
some incorrect models is rather low.</p>

<p>Remember a picture from above of general limitations on the
agent interactions within the information space. Following this
the observer has realistic images of the agents when and only
when the given agent group can adjust the frequency of changes in
its information images on appropriate level. If the frequency of
changes fits well to the possibilities of data transfer without
losing information actuality to the distance from the observer to
the agents then the observer will be able to interact with the
agents.</p>

<p>Due to objective reasons an economic system has non-ideal
level of current ICT development and some level of stochastic
changes in the system. So it is always possible to find groups of
agents within the space of a large-scale economic system that do
not have technical means to organize information exchange at the
level required for their interaction. Persistent stochastic
changes in all the parts and objects of economic system devalue
the content of information flows disseminated. With the given
velocity of the changes in the state of agents requiring
appropriate coordination with the partners, and limitations on
the information dissemination velocity, it is always possible to
determine the maximum distances within the system space exceeding
which means technical impossibility of agent interaction. In
previous sections this fact was a reason for selecting zones <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> (see Fig. 3). However, by decreasing the
necessity to coordinate the changes in their state the agents are
able to organize interactions at the distances that exceed
theoretically possible values. So if agents simultaneously slow
down the level of their information image's changes, they will
get conditions to interact each other in wider boundaries then
before.</p>

<p>If information exchange level required for agent interactions
cannot be attained by technical means (by changing information
permeability of the environment), conditions necessary for the
interaction can be created by institutional means. Agent can
adopt behavior rules common for all of them; in accordance with
the above their information images estranged to the outside
environment, their information images should match certain
standards. If the standards regulate the permissible upper limit
of the degree of information image variability, then the set of
agents that adhere to this standard, will form their own
information images that will be uniform in their mutability
extent. The totality of the latter uniform images can be
considered as an independent sub-space for agent interaction; its
content has certain relationship with the processes of change in
the real space of economic system.</p>

<p>In fact, agents here should create a certain projection of
real space. This projection has to differ from the reality in, at
least, deceleration of the change processes. By designing
institutional structures, agents can form projections of real
space that reflect real processes with various decelerations.
Each of these institutional limitations outlines the sub-spaces
and makes for the establishment of new agent interaction
conditions and channels. As a result, interactions become
possible within broader spatial boundaries that would be
unattainable without the use of appropriate institutional
structures.</p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><font size="2">From the
        point of view of individual agent-observer (see a man at
        the left side on Fig. 4), his interaction with variously
        remote groups of potential partners (one or many men at
        the right side on Fig. 4) requires him to design and
        maintain a whole set of his information images made to
        the standards of the corresponding sub-spaces. So the
        observer has several parallel channels and sub-space to
        interact with other agents (four parallel sub-spaces on
        Fig. 4). To make a set of his potential partners wider he
        has to simplify his information image according rules and
        standards of appropriate institutional structures. </font></td>

<p>Thus, certain set of institutional structures operating in an
economy, segments the entire space of the system into a certain
number of sub-spaces with their own rules and parameters of agent
interactions. The more remote interactions are to be organized,
the higher deceleration of real processes is to be implemented
when designing the corresponding sub-space.</p>

<p>In similar vein, the more remote interactions those sub-spaces
are mediating, the stronger are the discrepancies between real
processes in an economic system and their reflection in
sub-spaces. It would be logical to assume that long-term
functioning of these sub-spaces should be completed by a
procedure of bringing the state of subspaces into accord with the
real state of the economic system.</p>

<p>Now we have a general picture of context where information
interactions take place. The next step is to describe a scheme of
interactions in details.</p>
