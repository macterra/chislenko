Scheme of Information Interactions: The Main Blocks</b></font></a></p>

<p>Institutional structures set the limits of people’s
interaction in the process of their socioeconomic activity (see
above sections). Separate institutional structure could be
imagined as a meta-model or a framework of a kind of interactions
between individual agents that conduct activities “inside”
it. The typical functions of such framework are the following
three:</p>

<p>1. The switch of the joint activity participants (agents) from
the “free” state that precedes their amalgamation within a
certain organization, to a constrained state when they are
already organization members and have formed the necessary
relationships with its members. Here, institutional mechanism is
working of coordination of opportunities and intentions of the
agents relative to their potential joint activity.</p>

<p>2. The use of organizational relationships between agents for
attaining the goals which were the reason for the establishment
of the relationships. Coordination of the organization members’
activity in the process of joint activity which at this stage has
been exercised via organizational mechanism.</p>

<p>3. Termination of membership in organization (breach of
relationship) and agent return to the free state.</p>

<p>Further we shall examine the work principles of the first item
in detail, and second – in general.</p>

<p>There arises a question: what is the content of specific human
activity that creates an efficient institutional mechanism? </p>

<p>According a general picture of institutional structure, of
direct information interactions, of &quot;cognition cycle&quot;,
and etc that was discussed in sections above, we can summarize
the following: </p>

<p>By means of interaction exchange, agents participate in the
collective formation of a certain information image (model) of
their environment (<a
href="refer.htm#Michael Lachmann, Guy Sella, Eva Jablonka">Michael
Lachmann, Guy Sella, end Eva Jablonka</a>; <a
href="refer.htm#Scott Moss and Bruce Edmonds">Scott Moss and
Bruce Edmonds</a>) and possible joint activity. Agents use this
information model for simulating different variants of their
activity. Doing this they verify and coordinate their viewpoint
of the content of their joint activity as well as define the
place of each agent within the system of labor division between
them. At a certain stage of coordination and specification the
agents begin to consider the current state of information image
of the joint activity to be acceptable for practical
implementation. After that they are able to make the appropriate
re-configuration of the links, and to readjust the type of their
activity. In the process of re-configuration production relations
are changed through which intermediate results of agent
production activity are disseminated (in accordance with
technological series). Also, distributive relationships can be
changed through which the final results of the agent collective
activity are fed back to them in the form of resources for
maintaining their activity.</p>

<p>The outline of agents information interactions in a more
detailed and formalized form is represented in following
sub-sections:</p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974716"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Interaction
space</i></b></font></a><font face="Arial"><b><i> </i></b></font></p>

<p>1. Let us specify a set <i>A</i> consisting of n agents <font
face="Times New Roman"><i>À(i)</i></font>, where <i>i = 1…n</i>.
</p>

<p>2. Specify space <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ð</i></font>
in which agents conduct their interactions and which contains the
whole agent set <i>A</i> as well as set <i>Z</i> of the rest of
economic system players different from the set <i>A</i>: Let <i>P{A,
Z}</i>. More detailed description of the features of the space
for economic interactions see in above sections.</p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974717"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Macro-technolog</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>y</i></b></font></p>

<p>3. Set macro-technology <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ì</i></font>.
Its description sees above in the previous section. Let the
number of jobs in the macro-technology be <i>n</i> and,
consequently, it will coincide with the number of agents in set <i>A</i>.
For each macro-technology job <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ì(j)</i></font>
(where <i>j = 1,…,n</i>) its output is <i>V(j,i)</i>, defined
for each agent <font face="Times New Roman"><i>À(i)</i></font>
from the set <font face="Times New Roman"><i>À</i></font>. Note
that &quot;output&quot; here characterizes a production process
result, “output” in the sense of final consumption is defined
below. Thus, a certain agent <i>k</i> has a coefficient vector <i>V(j,i=k)</i>
of his personal outputs that the macro-technology will produce if
he takes each of the jobs <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ì(j)</i></font>.
Assume that agents “know” their output values. E.g., they
experimentally found those values in the past. </p>

<p>Surmise the existence of differences between agents in their
skills relative to different jobs. Let there exist a clearly
defined agent specialization within the macro-technology set of
jobs for the existence of solutions for optimal agent
distribution over the jobs. Thus, we do not tolerate that a large
number of agents from the set <i>A</i> hold maximum output values
for the same macro-technology jobs. A small number of such
coincidences will not, apparently, influence the existence of at
least one optimal solution.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, for the time being we ignore such
variable as agent costs per unit of output. Let all the agents
from set <i>A</i> have equal cost values in the process of their
activity.</p>

<p>4. At the start point of the interaction scheme, the set of
agents will be randomly distributed over the jobs <i>M(j)</i>. As
a result, for a certain current moment we recorded what output is
“produced’ by each job. Total output <i>V</i> of the
macro-technology <i>M</i> is defined by the sum of values <i>V(j,i)</i>
for all the jobs, where i is the number of the agent who took job
<i>j</i> (items in this sum are equal to the corresponding output
of agents occupying certain jobs). Assume that there exists at
least one distribution of agents by the jobs – any deviation
from this distribution means diminution <i>V</i> (Pareto
optimum).</p>

<p>5. After the total output <i>V</i> on the use of
macro-technology <i>M</i> is formed, this final product of the
production process becomes a resource for maintaining living
conditions and development. Now it is designed for distribution
among agents. Let <i>V</i> be distributed in a certain manner
over the whole agent's set <i>A</i>. Denote the distribution
function as <i>F</i>. Then the share of total return received by
each agent in the process of distribution, is <i>F(V, A(i))</i>.
Assume that function <i>F</i> is linear by the agent return
factors (i.e., the higher the agent’s output, the higher share
he receives in the process of distribution <i>V</i>). </p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974718"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Mental model</i></b></font></a></p>

<p>6. Each agent <font face="Times New Roman"><i>À(i)</i></font>
has a mental model (<a href="refer.htm#Douglass C. North">D.
North</a>, 1994, p. 360) of space <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ð{A,Z}</i></font>,
which we denote as <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Î(À(i),Ð)</i></font>.
This model is initially created and exists in the human mind. The
mental model as a result of psychological reflection of the
environment by humans, is a copy (to a certain degree of
accuracy) of the structure of real space <font
face="Times New Roman"><i>Ð</i></font> (including the
relationships between agents). The difference of mental model
from its real prototype can be equal to zero (in this case,
mental model identically reflects all the economic system
components as well as their changes in time), or can have
significant deviations. To describe the general case, let us
introduce the distortion function <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ñ(A(i))</i></font>
that can be individual for every agent. Then identity <i>O(A(i),P)=C(A(i))*P{A,Z}</i>
holds. Let us assume (for simplicity) that there are no
distortions, i.e., <i>C(A(i))=1</i>.</p>

<p>In our description of the mental model we based on some
related research:</p>

<p>According to D. North, “humans perceive the outside world by
means of processing the information with the help of pre-existing
mental patterns that enable for understanding of the environment
and solving the problems arising (<a href="refer.htm#D. North">D.
North</a>, 1997, p.7). &quot;Ideas and ideologies do form
subjective mental patterns; with their assistance individuals
interpret the surrounding world and make their choice” (<a
href="refer.htm#D. North">D. North</a>, 1997, p.143).</p>

<p>B. Edmonds in his article (<a href="refer.htm#Bruce Edmonds">Bruce
Edmonds</a>) using the techniques close to genetic programming,
designs the simulation description of the agent behavior that
includes the population of the agent internal models describing
the environment that surrounds him. There is also similar
research on sharing information to support an evolution of
collective actions (<a
href="refer.htm#Michael Lachmann, Guy Sella, Eva Jablonka">Michael
Lachmann, Guy Sella, Eva Jablonka</a>).</p>

<p>Mental model will be wholly functional only when there is a
mechanism that continuously keeps it in the actual state. For
this purpose, information images of partner agents in the mental
model should be sufficiently well fit with the state of real
partners. Under small group conditions, a member of the group
makes an actualization of his mental model via continuous direct
information exchange with the other partners. Interactivity of
actualization procedure enables to view the mental model as some
collectively maintained substance that is not already the product
of an individual agent; however, it can exists only in his
consciousness. Starting from a certain level of information
technology development, mental model can be estranged from the
agent's mind to a certain information carrier; after that it
becomes one of the objects in the agent information habitat.</p>

<p>Conceptions related to the agent mental model can be
implemented as the following interaction scheme items.</p>

<p>7. Mental model <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Î(À(i),Ð{A,Z})</i></font>
is used by agent to design and simulate new configurations of
relationships (to take a new &quot;job&quot; in macro-technology)
with the purpose to enhance its output. The deviation of the
current agent distribution over the jobs from the theoretically
optimal is a reserve of future output enhancement. In the process
of using the model agents can find other variants of their
distribution by jobs that are more preferable than the current
variant by output of each of them. Thus, the agent generates a
new configuration of the system's space in his mental model <font
face="Times New Roman"><i>À(i): Î(À(i),Ð{A,Z})</i></font><i>
-&gt; </i><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Î'(À(i),Ð{A,Z})</i></font>.</p>

<p>In his mental model, an agent can construct the variants of
changes in the current relationship pattern desirable for
himself. This means that, as a result of accomplishing his local
task of increasing the return from his activity, the agent is
able to define a desirable version of reconfiguring the links
between the agents. In the general case, those proposals can
pertain not only to relations of a particular agent but any other
combinations of relationships. Local optimization task of an
agent can be written as: <i>max F(V, A(i))</i>, by variable <i>V</i>
obtained by sorting out the set of possible variants <font
face="Times New Roman"><i>Ð{A,Z}</i></font>.</p>

<p>Rather similar approach to the study of social systems based
on the agent computer modeling is proposed by S. Moss and B.
Edmonds (<a href="refer.htm#Scott Moss and Bruce Edmonds">Scott
Moss and Bruce Edmonds</a>). In their work &quot;Modeling
Learning as Modeling&quot; they describe how agents can lower the
errors in their forecasts via the change in the structural forms
of the environment models used by them. This is attained by
providing the agents with the opportunity to build the model of
their habitat. &quot;Specification of our agents’ models is
based on their observations of the data and the success with
which their models forecast the needed variables&quot;. </p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974719"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Collective
information model of the envir</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>onment </i></b></font></p>

<p>8. By definition, one of the aspects of agent interaction
under direct information exchange consists in the mutual
information on their capabilities and intentions. By means of
such information exchange of the “everybody with everybody”
type in the real time mode, mental images of capabilities and
intentions of each of them become known to all the rest of the
agents.</p>

<p>As a result, mental model of each agent is, actually, a
certain combination of mental models of all the agents.
Information activity of the partners creates their virtual
presence in the private mental model of each agent from the set <i>A</i>.

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%">Figuratively speaking, each
        of the partners is “responsible” for the content and
        actuality of a certain portion of the agent’s mental
        model. Each model fragment is filled and renovated (with
        certain accuracy and periodicity) as a result of
        information activity of one or several agents that have
        been reflected in the given fragment. Thus, the formal
        notation for a mental model should be rewritten as: <font
        face="Times New Roman"><i>Î(À(i),Ð{Î(À(l),Ð{A,Z}),Z})</i></font>,
        for all values of <i>l = 1,…,n</i>, but not equal to <i>i</i>.</td>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>9. It has been already discussed above that there are several
parameters that determine if a direct information exchange within
the given agents' group is possible at all. In this connection,
assume that information exchange intensity combined with the
intensity of changes in the states of agents and other objects of
space <i>P</i>, as well as the ability of each agent from set <i>A</i>
to process the information, are sufficient for the direct
information exchange being necessary for maintaining the mental
models of each of the players in the actual state. If this is
feasible, than within the given agents' group there should be a
tendency to the increased similarity of their private mental
models.</p>

<p>Assume that the whole set of agents constructs and plays
through the possible variants of reconfiguring the relationships
between them in the form of a unified, collectively maintained
information image of their habitat. Let us denote such image as
“collective information model&quot; of an economic system
(their living environment). In the general case, this information
model is stored in the mind of each agent; however, other
variants are also possible.</p>

<p>Assume that the information technology development level makes
it possible for the agents to estrange their mental models into
the outside environment in the form of certain information
objects. If this is done by a unified “standard”, then it is
possible to make a composition of the set of such information
objects. As a result, the agents receive information model of the
system that exists as a substance being outside their
consciousness. In a sense, internal models of the agents are
materialized as an external model common for all the agents from
set A. In this case, we can speak of the existence of a virtual
variant of the model in addition to its mental variant.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the interaction process under the
direct relations between agents that they “discuss” their
actions between themselves, “agree” upon mutually acceptable
actions and then “coordinate” their joint activity that they
agreed upon. Subject to our hypothesis on the existence of such a
substance as “collective information model of a system”, the
general outline of interactions described above could be
specified as follows:</p>

<dir>
    <li>Agents estrange their proposals on the new variants of
        activity and preferable re-combinations of their
        relationships into the information space of an economic
        system. The totality of such proposals received from all
        the agents of the system constitutes the domain of choice
        that is accessible for each agent. Agents assess the
        acceptability of existing proposals and make their own
        that, in their turn, are also evaluated by the rest of
        the agents. If the agent community identified in its
        domain of choice a mutually acceptable variant of
        reconfiguring their relationships, then the above
        variants is moved to the implementation stage; the
        collective model of relationships formed here, is further
        used for the current coordination of practical activity. </li>
</dir>

<p><a name="_Toc457974720"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Organizational
mechanism</i></b></font></a></p>

<p>10. If the agents have built a new information model of their
living system that would provide for the higher output from their
activity compared to the current system, the real system is
changed in accordance with this model. Here, the pattern of
information links established by the agents in the process of
formation and coordination of the new information model of the
system, becomes the prototype of organizational structure and the
basis for organizational mechanism. This mechanism would ensure
the maintenance and support of the new link system (organization)
in the process of its practical use.</p>

<p>Thus, institutional mechanism having accomplished its function
on moving the agents from the &quot;free&quot; to the
&quot;bound&quot; state, as a final result of its work, provides
possible all the necessary components that agents need for
starting their joint activity within a particular established
organization.</p>

<p><a name="_Toc457974721"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Material and
information sub-spaces of interactions</i></b></font></a></p>

<p>Going back to the content above on institutional structures as
sub-spaces of agents' interactions, we can note that there are
also two another sub-spaces that mediate different kinds of agent
activity: </p>

<p>First - material – includes real processes of creation,
distribution and consumption of resources.</p>

<p>Second - information – is the result of mental
(psychological) reflection of the first sub-space. It includes
the processes of forming the information image of the environment
as well as collective construction by the agents of a new
information image of the first sub-space on this basis.</p>

<p>Agents form in the information sub-space the image of a new
desirable material space and then rebuild the latter in
accordance with this image. There is a certain cyclic recurrence
in this process: information images of new links and types of
agents' activity being born in the second sub-space, are
partially materialized within the structure of the first
sub-space changing its current state. On the other hand, the new
state of the first sub-space being reflected in the agents’
mind, becomes the basis for generation of new states and
information images filling the second sub-space.</p>

<p>In compliance with those sub-spaces, agents network of links
formed at the “exit” of institutional mechanism, can also be
divided into two types: first – network of links for resource
exchanges, second – for information exchanges. </p>
