<H2>Abstract</H2>

<DIV ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P>Symbolic communication mechanisms played a significant part in the
evolutionary process by allowing plants, animals and humans to exchange
individual experiences and thus turning collections of relatively isolated
organisms into adaptive distributed cognition systems. A crucial role in this
process belongs to schemes of aggregating and generalizing individual
experiences and utilizing the obtained knowledge for optimization of behavior
of individual agents. Most recently, money as aggregate symbolic
representation of value allowed efficient distribution of economic information
in the society. By providing aggregated information on comparative values of
goods and services to participants with bounded interests and rationality, the
economic signaling mechanisms give them incentives to adjust their consumption
and production efforts in accordance with the collective requirements of all
other agents in the system. This allowed the complexity of the value exchange
system to increase by orders of magnitude, while improving its
adaptability.</P>

<P>With still greater complexity and scale of the system, it becomes crucially
important to assure that the agents focus on the right tasks, form reasonable
expectations of the utility of various goods and services, and set up stable
and mutually beneficial relationships with each other. These focusing and
utility assessment mechanisms have been traditionally provided by individual
experiences and unmediated sharing of knowledge, similar to value exchange
mechanisms before the appearance of money. Further progress of signaling
instruments depends on availability of standardized semantic descriptions of
quality and utility of various resources, and needs and abilities of different
agents. It also requires efficient methods of data acquisition, aggregation
and analysis, and low-cost communication and processing tools.</P>

<P>We are presenting an example of such a collection of signaling instruments.
The suggested model of a &quot;hyper-economic&quot; system combines flows of
globally aggregated scalar information on prices with mechanisms for sharing
knowledge about situational utilities of groups of resources. The project
presents methods for combining value and utility signaling mechanisms,
introduces  non-scalar representations of common experiences analogous to
derivative financial instruments and researches their efficiency in different
types of economics environments.</P>

<P>The new signaling instruments are aimed to aid individual agents in
optimizing their behavior by using available knowledge for assessing expected
personal costs, risks, and utilities. At the same time, more complex signaling
tools and automated semantic transports may allow the whole system to progress
to higher levels of complexity, efficiency, and adaptability, and develop
explicit global cognitive mechanisms, forming rudimentary reflective
consciousness and self-awareness of the system.</P>

<H2>Types of multi-agent systems</H2>

<P>There are  two  basic approaches to classification of multi-agent systems.
One is based on the appearance.  From this point of view, one can distinguish
an ecosystem, an organism, an economy, a society, a colony, a software system,
etc. These distinctions are largely phenomenological. One can often encounter
statements like &quot;Earth/Gaia is one super-organism&quot;. Some of these
analogies seem quite reasonable. For example, a communist economy may be
similar to an integrated organism, as its parts work directly on the central
order, and the role of financial flows is reduced to assist the centralized
regulatory mechanism. A contract economy looks much like a forest ecology,
except that agents get locked into relationships by contracts and mutual
understanding of partners' interests rather than rigid functional niches. </P>

<P>With all attractiveness of such comparisons, they are not very productive,
as there are no good definitions for types of systems that should be regarded
as an economy, an organism, or a society. Similarly, people have different
perceptions of goals and virtues of observed systems. An ecosystem supposedly
&quot;just lives&quot; and should be <I>stable and diverse</I>, an enterprise
is called to <I>maximize production</I> and should be <I>efficient and
safe</I>, and a social formation is expected to be <I>fair and moral</I>, and
keep its members <I>secure and happy</I>.</P>

<P>However, such perceptions often represent just wish lists rather than
understanding of evolutionary origins of these systems, or imperatives of
their internal functional dynamics.</P>

<P>The <I>functional approach</I> classifies multi-agent systems by their
overall complexity, internal control methods, structure, viscosity and
transport capacities of the communications space, methods of connecting agents
into stable working groups (mutual specialization, physical coupling, force,
emotional affection, ownership, contracts), diversity and intelligence of
agents, particular architectural types, etc. </P>

<P>The functional classification allows to put system analogies on a rational
foundation, helps to understand the nature and timing of system transitions
and detect general trends in systems evolution, such as increase in structural
liquidity and substrate independence, evolution of internal signaling
mechanisms, emergence of meta-levels of organization, etc.</P>

<P>A general functional theory may also help to predict where new systems may
have features qualitatively different from everything previously observed. For
instance, space within modern communication and computing environments is
effectively non-metric (it takes approximately the same time and effort to
phone anybody in a country, or address any memory unit within a computer).
This means that most space-related laws of all previous functional spaces
would not apply to &quot;digital&quot; systems: there is no concept of premium
location here, or differential rent, no &quot;reproductive isolation&quot; or
other influence of space-induced separation on agents' communication and
diversity.  Also digital systems often have lower replication costs of agents
than execution costs, which makes them dramatically different from all systems
more essentially embedded in their physical substrates. For physical entities,
it's much easier to perform a task than to transfer the necessary skills to
another object. For a computer it is just copying a program. Agent deployment
issues that are so fundamental for Cartesian space, seem largely irrelevant
for the digital environment.</P> <P>Together, these differences in essential
features create a foundation for system design that is dramatically different
from all previous natural and human agglomerations, in terms of agent
specialization, diversity, and deployment.</P>

<H2>Aggregate symbolic communications</H2>

<P>We call communications symbolic when the signal is determined by an
established convention rather than represents direct transfer of resources or
observations of natural agents' activities. Origins of symbolic communications
can be traced as far back as bacterial colonies. A bacterium emitting a
certain chemical signal relies on established convention. In many cases, it is
beneficial for an agent to aggregate all received signals before forming a
response. Doing this on an agent level  requires gathering of many individual
signals and processing of them by an agent.  In many cases, however, this
aggregation of signals can be performed by the message carrying environment,
which makes an individual agent's task much simpler, and also assures
coherence of perception among multiple agents.  For example, plants and
animals respond to combined signals coming from all sources of nutrients,
light, sounds, etc.  Internal organs of an organism respond to combined
requests of other parts for different resources, communicated through
&quot;analog&quot; (e.g., temperature) or symbolic (hormonal) means.
So here we have aggregate symbolic communications of needs, resources and
opportunities.</P>

<H2>Economy and beyond</H2>

<P>Modern economic relations are based on  communication of value
representations. By using quantitative symbols to represent typical value
relations between various objects, an economy allows efficient distribution of
resources in the system, and provides short-sighted selfish agents with
incentives to adjust their consumption and production efforts in accordance
with the collective requirements of all other agents. With time, an economy
develops more complex situational regulatory instruments, such as enterprise
shares, securities, voting rights, and access privileges - and then symbolic
aggregate knowledge, such as popularity ratings, publications of industry
trends and statistics and sample contract arrangements that have been observed
to be efficient in prototypical situations.</P>

<P>While the economy provides its agents with accurate estimates of generic
values of typical goods and services, it has little to offer to each
individual agent in their attempts to estimate the utility of a certain
product for their particular needs, or offer any other personalized or
situational advice.  This kind of knowledge is usually obtained by the
economic agents in about the same way they discovered average social values of
common products and services in pre-economic times: personal experience with
the environment and direct communication with other agents. There are no
quantitative instruments available for automated processing for this
purpose.</P>

<P>This is understandable: comprehensive detailed data about each agent's
behavior so far has not been available in a usable form, communication and
computational tools necessary for processing this data have not been adequate,
transaction costs have been too high, etc.  Recent introduction of fast
telecom networks, voluminous storage and efficient retrieval of information,
standardized representations of complex data and high-speed, low-cost
computational tools, created a foundation for &quot;a second signaling
mechanism&quot; in an economic system:  together with conventional aggregate
indicators of average costs of resources and services and their expectations,
the new crop of signaling instruments may deliver suggestions of expected
value that particular agents may derive in their individual situations from
such resources or services.  Then agents can be better equipped to optimize
their behavior by using all available knowledge for comparing personal and
global costs, risks, and utilities.</P>

<P>In an economy, these regulatory considerations stand behind the decisions
of market agents, and together with the internal logic of knowledge flows
represent the &quot;<I>invisible hands</I>&quot; of the market machinery.
Now, these &quot;hands&quot; can become publicly accessible.</P>

<P>Many elements of the hypereconomic signaling systems may change our
familiar economic notions, such as capital, interest, efficiency, liquidity,
inflation, emission rights, secondary and derivative instruments. Some of
these features will remain relatively unchanged but become more liquid (faster
distribution and lower transaction costs) and more efficient. Other parameters
may turn from scalar to vector or a more complex structure (e.g., augmentation
of the numerical representation of value of an object with a matrix of its
utilities for various purposes as estimated by different agents). Some
features, such as non-scalar &quot;situational/detail derivatives&quot; for
assessing values and risks of, and balancing among, particular utilities will
be entirely new.</P>

<P>Similar changes will happen with the concepts from social and ecological
fields.  Communities do not have to be local anymore, they may have
variable/adaptable geometries, relations between managing and performing
agencies will be redefined, new control structures and dynamic patterns arise,
etc. </P>

<H2>Some applications for hypereconomy</H2>

<P>There may be many different systems using various aggregate representations
of needs, utilities, usage suggestions, and their combinations and
derivatives.  The following are three simple examples illustrating possible
uses of the suggested situational utility communications.</P>

<H3>Recommendation systems for consumer items</H3>

<P>The price of an item, such as a book, an instrument, or a travel package,
may be taken from the general catalog. The estimates of utility of this items
would come from the collective experience of other people with similar needs
and interests who have experience with this or similar items.  Some
computational constructs needed for summarizing and delivering situational
knowledge, such as utility trends on item/consumer clusters and prototypical
preference profiles, represent hyper-economic equivalents of secondary and
derivative signaling instruments in the conventional economy.</P>

<H3>Targeted advertising</H3>

<P>The same mechanisms that can advise items to consumers, may suggest
potential consumers to manufacturers of these items.  In the current
situation, an advertiser knows the exact price of the ad delivery, but
targeting of ads is usually very costly and inaccurate.  As a result, most of
the multi-billion-dollar advertising industry efforts miss their targets and
annoy people, while knowledge of many good products doesn't reach the
individuals who may benefit from them. An advanced mechanism for combining and
sharing (for a price) metabolites of advertising and sales information of all
companies would result in more efficient proliferation of useful goods and
services, support for small and specialized market segments and dramatic
reduction of targeting costs.</P>

<H2>Computational heuristics</H2>

<P>In a large AI system, computational/royalty costs for all algorithms may be
known, but it is also important to estimate the expected benefits of applying
each algorithm to each problem. In an &quot;intelligent soup&quot; of a
&quot;market AI&quot; system, multiple problem generators and solvers can
share not just information on the current value and availability of
computational resources, but also suggestions of what methods appear to be of
the highest utility for what problems, and how they may be better applied.  As
a result, the system may combine cognitive and economic mechanisms and deliver
efficient solutions at low costs.</P>

<H2>Software model</H2>

<P>Our first implementation of the hypereconomy model explores the situation
where a large number of agents access a multitude of different resources, and
attempt to maximize their utility.  Both agents and resources are grouped into
categories that share certain utility functions. Each agent and each resource
may belong to multiple usage categories.  During the model run, each agent
acquires a certain amount of experience that allows it to optimize resource
use.  However, the individual experience is insufficient for optimal selection
of resources - and especially at the beginning of the agent's function, when
it has only a limited number of encounters with a few resources.  To help
guide the behavior of the agent, groups of agents and resources belonging to
each usage category, collect their experiences into several repositories.</P>

<P>On the most detailed level, there are records of experiences of individual
agents with individual resources.  Each record consists of the total number of
agent/resource interactions, and the average result, currently a numeric
value. On the next level (individual situational utility) there are records of
the average performance of an agent with each category of resources, and
average performance of a category of agents with each resource.  The level of
global individual utility contains records of global average performance of
each agent and each resource, in any situation. Average situational utility
records contain data on average utility of categories of agents with
categories of resources.</P>

<P>The experience levels can be represented in the following diagram:
<HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="0%" SIZE=1></P>

<P><IMG SRC="hypereconomy_knowledge_diagram.gif" ALT="Hypereconomy Knowledge diagram" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=240></P>

<P>When estimating expected utility of a particular resource, an agent
supplements its own experience with more general knowledge, relying largely on
the most detailed layers with representative amount of experience.</P>

<P>For the first application of the model we chose an internet advertisement
exchange system.  The system contains thousands of participating websites.
Each site displays banner ads of other sites, and has those sites display its
banners in exchange.  This is a very popular way of trading advertisements on
the Web, with some of competing systems having membership up to 200,000
participating websites with 5 million page views per day. Selection of
appropriate ads for display on each page determines the performance of such a
system.  Appropriate ads suggest browsing users other related and interesting
sites; irrelevant ads just annoy the users and waste screen space and network
bandwidth.  The system can greatly benefit from an automated economy as it
provides a flexible and adaptive optimization mechanism. At the same time,
this exchange system is also an ideal material for a model, as it provides a
huge amount of symbolic data for processing, coming from millions of different
users, and has clear criteria of quality (percentage of banners that were
clicked on).  An economic optimization model may allow different websites to
bid for the right to display the banners that are most appropriate for them.
However, to determine which banners are the most appropriate, the site needs
to have a representative amount of  displays (at least a few hundred) for each
banner in the system, which means millions of ad displays for each site before
it can make rational choices. This is practically impossible. The task of
appropriate banner selection becomes much easier if the sites start exchanging
information about their attempts to display different banners. The
hyper-economic approach here consists of sharing the experience among groups
of similar websites and banners (treated as resources in the system)  of their
interactions with each other.  This allows the system to rapidly learn optimal
connections between the agents and resources, quickly react to changing
conditions, and maintain greater efficiency during its operation.</P>

<H2>Results of the model test</H2>

<P>We have tested the banner selection system with random resource allocation
mechanism, a utility-based scheduling algorithm (every agent selects the best
resource currently available, regardless of price), an adaptive economic
optimization mechanism, economic mechanism extended with considerations of
global resource utility, and the hyper-economic system with situational
utility.  In the experiments on a reasonably diverse system with 700 ads in 30
categories, the hypereconomy provided the highest adaptation rate, and
greatest overall efficiency out of all tested methods.</P>

<H2>Further development</H2>

<P>In many cases, optimization of individual utility contradicts the goals of
global optimization.  A good example may be exploration tasks.  The best
strategy for each individual agent is to avoid using untested tools and
resources until other agents have gathered some experience with them.  Without
rewards for exploratory activities a collection of selfish agents will suffer
from &quot;the tragedy of commons&quot;.  One method to solve the problem is
to introduce advisory meta-agencies that would pay individuals for exploratory
activities, and own the resulting knowledge, using it for providing paid
guidance to other agents.  This method appears more efficient than programming
generic instinctive curiosity into individual agents, as it allows coordinated
gathering of social experience on a meta-agent level.</P>

<P>With meta-agencies collecting individual experiences and forming aggregated
situational and general utility estimates, the system may evolve into a set of
knowledge clusters and situational experts, with original agents turning into
limited execution units, performing suggested tasks, reporting the experience,
and gathering payments.</P>

<P>This architecture does not seem to have good analogs in biological and
social systems because of their limited ability to gather and process
aggregated symbolic constructs.</P>

<P>With vastly improved communication and data processing tools and very small
transaction costs the multi-agent systems can develop greater functional
granularity and fluid social architectures.</P>

<P>We can envision the future intelligence as a collection of highly
specialized tools, with high-bandwidth interconnections, with
&quot;personalities&quot;, or complex problem solvers (&quot;achievers&quot;,
&quot;goal engines&quot;, &quot;research tools&quot;, &quot;development
threads&quot;) consisting of limited contractual relations between multiple
problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting entities, that can at the
same time be employed in many other similar relations.  So the entities may
use the same &quot;body parts&quot; on a cooperative or time-sharing
basis.</P>

<P>We hope that hyper-economic schemes will eventually develop to store and
process increasingly complex representations of agent interests and utilities,
and have a great variety of competing intelligent algorithms for optimizing
system processes, thus turning into a hybrid of an economic self-regulatory
mechanism, complex multifaceted community, and distributed artificial
intelligence, with secondary data representation and signaling mechanisms
forming emerging self-awareness of the new systems.</P>

<P>It seems noteworthy that in these constructs, as well as in conventional
economy, the meta-signaling [generalized/abstract in relation to actual
&quot;field agents&quot;] level is represented in terms of signal currents in
the semantic space rather than crisp symbolic constructs. We can interpret
this as a sign that the connectionist approach is natural for a fetal stage of
any system intelligence.  Or, that a combination of symbolic processing with
signal flow patterns may extend the human balance of symbolic reasoning and
intuition to further levels of intelligence.</P>
