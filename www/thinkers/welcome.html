formal set of criteria for accepting and classifying nominations,
and would like to turn this page - already with about 60,000
visitors a year - can turn into an objective public resource. For
that, I would need assistance and funding. Please let me know if
you can help in any way. Meanwhile, you can at least click on a
few ads on this site, to add a few cents to its development. <br>
