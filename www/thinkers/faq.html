<UL>
<LI> How can one suggest more candidates into the list?
<BR> - Please select candidates, URLs, and icons, and
<A HREF="mailto:sasha1@netcom.com?subject=URL(s) and reasons to include the following visionary thinker(s)">
mail them to me!</A>
<LI>What is the easiest way to link to the Thinkers site?
<BR>
 - Please see <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/thinkers_linkto.html">Instructions</a>
<LI>It's probably a lot of work to maintain such a site, and provide value to hundreds of thousands
of visitors.   I realize that most Web users would not help with the site.  I am a different
kind of user, and I want to support this extremely valuable work.
<BR> - Wow, am I glad you asked!
Please see <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/participate.html">how you can participate</A>
<LI> Why aren't there more womyn, African Americans, and representatives of other equally
valuable social and ethnic groups on this list?!  Why?  Eh?   No, you tell me!
Are you just one of those white male oppressors?  Why aren't you answering?
I sent my previous email at 4am your time, and now it's already 4:03 !!!
<BR> -
I classify visionary thinkers by their ideas, not by physiological characteristics.
Historically, white males seem to have invented, created, and destroyed more stuff
than other groups, for various historical reasons that can be lamented or celebrated
together with their results.  The role of this site is to reflect the state of the world,
and give credit to those minds that made it into what it is, regardless of their
bodily equipment.
</p>
<LI>Why is your site called "Lucifer"?  Are you a devil worshiper?
I just recommended your site to my friends, and then - oh horrors! - noticed this lucifer thing.
Please drop all your work and apologize to me and other suspicious supersticious folks
out there.   We all know that you can't possibly spend your time more productively.
<BR>The myth describes Lucifer as the Bringer of light, an angel who questioned the
authority of God and went out to explore things on his own.  Of course, it is just a myth,
and no person worthy of following the ideas of great thinkers would take myths of Lucifer,
Big Bad Wolf or any other character at face value.
<P>
There is a wonderful <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/lucifer.html">story by Max More</A>
about Lucifer as a mythological figure of <A HREF="http://www.extropy.org">extropian movement</A>
and this server was named after these ideas.   I was just donated some space on it, and am
trying to provide some useful service to people who raise themselves above myths.
If you have not done so yet, please go to grade school, and then come back.
