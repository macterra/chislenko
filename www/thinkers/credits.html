The idea of this website belongs to <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/home.html">
Alexander Chislenko</A> who has been developing it since about 1994.  Over these years,
many people contributed to this website.  Most recent site collaborators include Andrey Sysoew
and Rion Snow.  Great thanks to David MacFadzean who has been providing his server
for free for years.
<P>
All really important work, of course, was done by people listed on the site who
made their names and ideas worth mentioning.
