	<li>Broken links frustrate your customers and make you look bad. Fix the 164 broken link(s) on your site by editing the Parent 
files that contain references to these links. You can find details of these problems in the Broken Links and Broken Pages report.
	<li>Customers will start to leave your site after waiting more than 15 seconds for a page to load. Consider reducing the 
size of the 32 slow page(s) on your site by reducing the size of graphics, number of graphics or amount of text.
	<li>Over 0% of the content on your site is over 6 Month(s) old. By updating your site with fresh content you can increase 
repeat traffic and customer satisfaction. Also you may wish to examine old content to ensure that it is still relevant.
	<li>Linkbot found 1 link(s) to local files on your hard disk or network drive. These links may not work for your customers 
as they will not likely have access to your network. Change the link path to reflect addresses on your Website.

	<li>You can improve your site's accessibility to users with disabilities by ensuring that you use ALT tags when ever possible and that all of your documents have titles.  You should also ensure that pixel 0,0 is mapped on server-side image maps.

<ol type="1">
	<li>Consider adding author tags to your site using Metabot. If you include author tags, Linkbot can give you author 
		by author breakdowns of your site's problems.
	<li>Consider automating the creation of these reports at regular intervals using Linkbot's built-in scheduler. By 
		automating website testing you will reduce the number of errors found and save yourself precious time.
	<li>Add height and width attributes to your image tags to improve page rendering.
	<li>Consider activating the Orphan Analysis to clear out unused files from your Server.
	<li>Consider fixing the temporary redirects found in the Warnings Report. Temporary redirects can slow the performance 
		of your server by adding unnecessary transactions.
