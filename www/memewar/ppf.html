<P>

Demand legalization and proper government regulation of
cannabis, ecstasy, magic mushrooms, mescaline, LSD and
other <STRONG>benign psychedelics</STRONG> !
<HR>
<UL>
<P><LI>Numerous evidence shows that benign psychedelics are indispensable
in many spiritual and religious practices, and essential in artistic expression,
philosophical and political discourse. These are activities protected by
the <STRONG>First Amendment</STRONG>. Demand the repeal of
anti-constitutional restrictions !

<P><LI>Benign psychedelics have many medical and psychological uses
including treatment for depression, schizophrenia, obesity
and anorexia.  Hence their placement on Schedule I is fraudulent !

<P><LI>The genuine risks of benign psychedelics are far lower than the
risks of alcohol, tobacco, driving and many other legal activities.
At the same time, their spiritual and emotional benefits can be
much greater. Demand rational and consistent government policy !

<P><LI>The main risks of benign psychedelics - persecution, fear, crime,
and contamination by unknown substances - directly result from
Prohibition, the government's failure to properly regulate
psychedelic use and quality.  Demand harm reduction !

<P><LI>The government abdicated its responsibility to provide protection
to the people via control for quality of psychedelics and via regulation of
their use. Such regulation could be done in a fashion similar to alcohol
and tobacco regulation, or via a rational system of courses, competence
tests, and <EM>self-prescription licenses</EM>. Demand that the government
stops abdicating its responsibility !


<P><LI>There are widespread phobias against psychedelics and people who
use them. These phobias are similar to racism, homophobia, anti-semitism,
fear of poor people, etc. These phobias are largely due to the gross
self-perpetuating misrepresentations in the media and in public discourse.
Fight the phobias in others and in yourself ! Recognize and tell the truth!


<P><LI>Many people who use psychedelics feel guilty about it, because the
society has labeled psychedelic use as &quot;wrong&quot;. These guilty
feelings are similar to those experienced by many Gays and Lesbians in a
phenomenon known as internalized homophobia. The Gay and Lesbian community
introduced the concept of Gay Pride  in order to prevent this. If you use
psychedelics, please recognize and support Psychedelic Pride, free
yourself from your own internalized phobias ! There is nothing in
<STRONG>benign use of psychedelics</STRONG> to feel guilty about !
Psychedelics can be used positively for personal and spiritual growth,
creativity enhancement, better physical and mental health, and happier
life. Just do not abuse them; do not endanger your and other people's
lives, health, and careers ! If you use psychedelics, use them
<STRONG>responsibly</STRONG>. Educate yourself about proper doses,
intervals, techniques via books and the Web !  If you use psychedelics,
consider whether your goals for such use are proper. Make sure that you
can be <STRONG>proud</STRONG> of your psychedelic practices !!!

<P><LI>Stand for our <STRONG><EM>unalienable Rights</EM>:<EM> Life, Liberty, and the
Pursuit of Happiness</EM></STRONG> !!!

&quot;The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered
considerably by the Prohibition law, for nothing is more
destructive of respect for the government and the law of the
land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.&quot;
