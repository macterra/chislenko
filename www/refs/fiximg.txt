NAME
       fiximg.pl - add WIDTH and HEIGHT to IMG tags in HTML files.

SYNOPSIS
       fiximg.pl -h
       fiximg.pl [ options ] htmlfile [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fiximg.pl examines HTML files and changes IMG tags to hold the WIDTH
       and HEIGHT sizes. Putting the size in IMG tags will speed up loading
       the page with Netscape. When HTML files are edited manually, putting
       in  the  sizes  is quite a hassle. fiximg.pl will try to locate each
       indicated image, and determine its size if it is a GIF or JPG image.

       Images are located in two ways:

       1.     the filename of the image starts with a "/". In this case the
              DocumentRoot as set in fiximg.pl (change it to local path) is
              used.

       2.     the filename of the image starts with a "~". The user will be
              looked up in /etc/passwd, and his directory public_html will
              be used.

       3.     in  all  other  cases  the  path  to  the  html file is used.

       Unless  there  are aliases for certain image directories this scheme
       should work.

       The size is then put in the IMG tag, leaving intact everything other
       than  the old WIDTH and HEIGHT. This means that if the old WIDTH and
       HEIGHT  were used to resize the image, the effect will be discarded.

       The  original  htmlfile  will be backupped to its original name with
       ".bak" appended.

OPTIONS
       -h     Displays this manual page.

       -l     Treat symbolic links as well. The default is not to treat
              symbolic links, because the original file should be treated
              instead of the link to it.

BUGS
       The  program  might not work because the path to Perl in the first
       line  of  fiximg.pl  is wrong. See if the path is correct by doing
       'which perl'  at  your Unix prompt. If it is not correct, you will
       have to edit the first line.

       Beware  of  so-called  Redirects;  in  our  case  our DocumentRoot 

              /vol/www/thalia/web-docs/

       was  redirected  to "/thalia". This caused errors when images were
       accessed  as  "/thalia/gifs/image.gif".  The  real  image would be

              /vol/www/thalia/web-docs/gifs/image.gif

       but the program would come up with the filename

              /vol/www/thalia/web-docs/thalia/gifs/image.gif

       We  solved  it  by making a link in the DocumentRoot directory, to
       itself,  with  the name "thalia" ("ln -s . thalia"). You have been
       warned.
