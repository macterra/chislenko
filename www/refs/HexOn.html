<H2> Is the communications decency act going to put a crimp in your e-mail?</H2>

<STRONG>&quot;HexOn Exon&quot;</STRONG> program written by Robert Carr
allows people to e-mail filthy messages to one
another while preventing children and government police agencies from
intercepting the messages and becoming distressed by their contents.
<P>
<H3>Here is an example of how &quot;HexOn Exon&quot; works:</H3>
<P>
Ms. Jane Doe, a pesticide saleswoman from Vacaville, California, wishes to
e-mail her friend (and pesticide wholesaler), Mr. John Q. Public, the
following passage from Nicholson Baker's novel, &quot;The Fermata&quot; (Random House,
1994):
<P>
<EM>
 &quot;It was a handsome dick, no question; watching him, Marian felt she needed
to hold that purple stanchion for herself at least once. &quot;Sylvie?&quot; she asked.
&quot;You won't mind if I make sure your lover is good and stiff for you, will
you?&quot;
<BR>
 &quot;No, just do it fast and get him in there!&quot; said Sylvie, kissing her own
bicep muscle. &quot;Either that or shove one of those big dildo-dicks up my cunt
and jerk him off into my asshole. Your choice, But get something big up my
cunt now!&quot;
</EM>
<P>
Under proposed federal legislation, e-mailing this passage could land Ms. Doe
in federal prison, and she could lose her pesticide business as well.
<P>
But if she and Mr. Public each owned a copy of &quot;HexOn Exon&quot;, she could send
this message, and any other text message, without fear of getting caught by
the government or destroying the moral fibre of our nation's youngsters. She
would simply first run the text of her e-mail through the program before
sending it.
<P>
&quot;HexOn Exon&quot; incorporates a search-and-replace routine, using the names of
the 84 Senators who voted in favor of the Exon amendment as code words for
naughty terms.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>dick = feinstein
<DD>dildo = boxer
<DD>stiff = lugar
<DD>cunt = exon
<DD>asshole = kerry
<DD>jerk = dole
<DD>etc.
</DL>

<H3>Here's the sample output:</H3>

<EM> &quot;It was a handsome feinstein, no question; watching him, Marian felt she
needed to hold that purple stanchion for herself at least once. &quot;Sylvie?&quot; she
asked. &quot;You won't mind if I make sure your lover is good and lugar for you,
will you?&quot;
<BR>
 &quot;No, just do it fast and get him in there!&quot; said Sylvie, kissing her own
bicep muscle. &quot;Either that or shove one of those big boxer-feinsteins up my
exon and dole him off into my kerry. Your choice, But get something big up my
exon now!&quot;
</EM>
<P>
Ms. Doe can now safely e-mail her message to Mr. Public. When Mr. Public
receives the message, he simply runs it back through his copy of &quot;HexOn Exon&quot;
to get the original text.
<P>
Yes, now you can have your exon and eat it too!
