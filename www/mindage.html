The advent of the Mind Age of intelligent robots envisioned by
<A HREF="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/">Hans Moravec</A>
will bring profound transformations in global social and technological
structures and relations of an advanced intelligence to its environment. The
ability of future machines to directly share experiences and knowledge with
each other will lead to evolution of intelligence from relatively isolated
individual minds to highly interconnected structural entities. The development
of a network of communicating mobile and stationary devices may be seen as a
natural continuation of biological and technological processes leading to a
community of intentionally designed and globally interconnected structures. The
growing reliance of system connections on functional, rather than physical,
proximity of their elements will dramatically transform the notions of
personhood and
<A HREF="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?identity">identity</A>
and create a new community of distributed &quot;infomorphs&quot;
- advanced informational entities - that will bring the ongoing process of
liberation of functional structures from material dependence to its logical
conclusions. The infomorph society will be built on new organizational
principles and will represent a blend of a superliquid economy, cyberspace
anarchy and advanced consciousness. The new system will incorporate many of
today's structures and will develop new traits transcending the limits of human
understanding. Its evolution will evade human control, but relations of
descendants of humans and today's machines will be largely symbiotic and will
lead to the emergence of a new

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Moravec's Visions</H2>

In his new book, &quot;Mind Age: Transcendence Through Robots&quot;,
<A HREF="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/">Hans Moravec</A>
describes further stages in the evolution of the robotics industry, where each robot
will learn from experience, adapt to changing environments and eventually acquire real
intelligence approaching- and then exceeding - that of humans. The intelligent
machines are expected to replace humans in most tasks we are capable of. This will
raise a plethora of issues, from human unemployment to ethical treatment of robots and
the task of taming their runaway intelligence.
<P>
   &quot;Mind Age&quot; is a provocative and compelling book that I recommend to
anyone interested in the structural evolution of the world. In this essay, I will
build from Moravec's conclusions and suggest some complementary ideas, mostly related
to the distributed architecture of future intelligence that I consider important for
exploring the Mind Age.

<H2><A name="RTFToC3"><CENTER>Knowledge Sharing</CENTER></A></H2>

  Learning from the experience is a very useful skill. If your robot slips on a
banana peel a number of times, it will be less likely to do it again in the
future. However, processing of limited personal experience by limited
intelligence is bound to bring limited results. The derived knowledge may be
incomplete, inconsistent, and clumsily formulated, which will lead to false
conclusions, arbitrary beliefs and superstitions - the typical content of any
primitive mind.
<P>
   Robots who already had that educational banana peel experience could share
it, together with some conclusions, with your robot. Or - better yet, they
could share information with the nearest knowledge processor, which would
combine one robot's experience with that of others, develop efficient general
algorithms for identifying similar situations and taking appropriate actions,
and then <A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?download">download</A>
them to all participating robots.
<P>
  Humans obtain most of their knowledge by learning from experience and from
the conclusions of others, despite their poor memory, low communication speeds
and inability to transfer knowledge directly.  One may expect information
sharing among robots, who are not handicapped by any of these limitations, to
be much more efficient. Furthermore, information storage and processing costs
in large stationary machines may be much lower than in small, mobile units.
Elimination of redundant computations within millions of robots would make a
networked system greatly more efficient than a collection of unconnected
machines. Sharing of experience may prove to be a still greater benefit. Thus,
cooperative knowledge processing would be several orders of magnitude less
expensive and at the same time vastly more productive. Such advantages make the
networked design an imperative rather than a matter of taste.

<H2>
<A name="RTFToC4"><CENTER>Putting Networked Robots to Work</CENTER></A>
</H2>
Rather than functioning as independent entities, networked robots and other smart
machines would work more like semi-intelligent, semi-autonomous front-ends of the
global system. Your home, for example, will have a number of devices with varying
types and degrees of mobility, sensitivity and intelligence  - and so will cars,
factories, highways, spaceships, etc. These devices will interact with larger machines
and each other for continuous data backups, experience sharing, and knowledge
upgrading.
<P>
  Each networked machine would ultimately rely on global intelligence, and
would only locally store the knowledge that is frequently used or may be
urgently needed. For example, if somebody starts telling your robot a joke in
ancient Greek, it will forward the sound stream to the nearest linguistics
expert and receive the meaning of the message, a suggested witty reply, a Greek
speech parser and a briefing on Greece before it finishes the polite chuckle
recommended by its own processor as an easy way to buy time.
<P>
   Actually, it may not even be necessary to receive the full parser and knowledge
base, as the &quot;remote thinking&quot; service could provide a more efficient
alternative - unless those ancient Greeks are about to permanently disconnect your
robot from the Net.
<P>
  Dependence on external sources of knowledge will hardly be a serious limitation
since robots, just as all other open (dissipative) systems, will critically depend on
connections to many other resources, from information about the environment to energy
and materials. The actual balance of intelligence between a local client and the rest
of the system will depend on various technical factors and may range from fully
autonomous machines working in remote or dangerous locations, to a completely
&quot;dumb&quot; front end, such as a sensor or an actuator connected to the network.
A mobile machine could exchange information continuously via a slow wireless link to
obtain urgent communications, news updates, and small software enhancements, and
periodically plug into the high-bandwidth network for larger information transfers.

<H2>
<A name="RTFToC5">
             <CENTER>Structure of Global Intelligence</CENTER>
</A></H2>
The architecture of the global intelligent network will undoubtedly be quite complex.
Various parts of each robot's intelligence will be shared with multiple archiving and
knowledge-providing host computers based on a variety of economic, privacy, and
security considerations. In general, new knowledge may be bought or rented by robots
or their owners, as automated production and distribution of information becomes the
primary area of economic activity. One may also get
<A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?beta+test">beta-test</A> knowledge
for free or agree to run experimental programs for pay; people can also get paid for
putting their machines into conditions where they could generate valuable new
experiences. Participants may also want to specify what information can be shared with
other parts of the system, what can be used only for generalization, and what should
not be shared at all, but just archived in an encrypted form.
<P>
   Most of the main networking components of such a system have already been
designed or at least conceived.  Today's communication protocols,
<A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?mirror">mirrored</A> file
servers, public key cryptography, collaborative information filtering schemes,
message authentication algorithms, computational economies, computerized
banking and other network constructs will evolve into essential parts of future
global intelligence.<P>
<P>
  This system will not be a gigantic superorganism, despite the implied high
degree of structural integration. The global &quot;mind&quot; will be compartmentalized,
with many relatively independent components and threads, separated from each
other by subject boundaries, as well as property, privacy, and security-related
interests.  Knowledge servers may have different world models, incompatible
<A HREF="http://www.einet.net/galaxy/Engineering-and-Technology/Computer-Technology/Artificial-Intelligence/Knowledge-Representation.html">
knowledge representations</A>
 or conflicting opinions. While complicating knowledge
development, functional compartmentalization will also increase the overall
stability and versatility of the system, as it will help contain the structural
faults within the subsystems that produced them and ensure safety of
information domains from hostile corruption.<P>

<H2>
<A name="RTFToC6"><CENTER>Global Mind, or... ?</CENTER>
</A></H2>
Painful historical experiences made centralization a scare word in discussions of
integrated projects.  But in this case, it doesn't seem to be a danger: physical
centralization is unlikely, since both safety of storage and traffic efficiency
require the existence of multiple remote archives and knowledge servers;
centralization in the sense of information processing is impossible, because the very
concept of a center is not applicable to a massively parallel, globally distributed
and extremely complex system.
<P>
  The notion of a single &quot;self&quot; in its traditional sense would not apply to
this system, or any single robot - though perhaps it can be applied to some
functional subsystems. The intelligent personalities of tomorrow will evolve
from today's philosophical systems, technological disciplines and software
complexes. Current human cultures may not leave functional heirs  as they are
based too heavily on the peculiarities of human nature. Physically connected
consciousness carriers will be left behind the evolutionary frontier. New
distributed systems will take the evolutionary lead, and physical objects will
adapt to more closely follow functional entities. (This process is already well
under way, in such forms as cultural and economic specialization.) The
resulting system is likely to represent a mix of a superliquid economy,
cyberspace anarchy, and consciousness architecture described by
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/minsky/minsky.html">Marvin Minsky</A>
in <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0671657135/alexanderchislenA">The Society of Mind</A>.
I doubt that it can be described by any single integrated theory.
<P>
   One can argue that many distributed systems already possess some reflective
consciousness. A computer network may locally store more information about its
global condition than a human consciousness has about its underlying layers (at
least, in relative terms). Philosophy spends a greater share of its effort
studying its own nature and purpose than most humans I know. The recent surge
in meta-disciplines and methodological and futurological studies is a clear
indicator that the global body of knowledge is becoming increasingly
self-conscious.
<P>
  It may be difficult to get used to dealing with a volatile distributed
entity.  Suppose your robot made some really stupid mistake.  You are mad at
it. The robot explains that the action was caused by a temporary condition in
the experimental semantic subnetwork and suggests to present to you a
hundred-<A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?terabyte">terabyte</A>
volume of incremental archives, memory snapshots and audit
trails from numerous servers involved in the making of the unfortunate
decision, containing a partial description of the state of the relevant parts
of the system at the time.  If you can even find the culprit, it's
non-material, distributed, and long gone.
<P>
   Now, what do you kick ?
<H2>
<A name="RTFToC7">
             <CENTER>Evolution of Distributed Systems</CENTER>
</A>
</H2>
   There is nothing really new in the idea of distributed functionality, just
as networking isn't only a recent trend in the computer industry. Throughout
all of the evolutionary process, more and more structural elements become
exosomatic (non-biological), distributed and shared.  Thousands of years ago,
people started storing more energy, materials and tools outside their bodies
than within them. This process is accompanied by a widening personal perception
of self, from identifying with ever  larger communities and even abstract
statements to assigning an increasing value to exosomatic personal parts (most
of us value our bank deposits higher than our fat deposits for personal
resource storage).
<P>
   Functional extensions to our once purely biological bodies evolve from
passive non-biological material additions (such as clothes) to information
transmitting shareable parts (e.g., thermometers as shared sensors) to active
distributed extensions (medicine as external shared immune system). The
progress here is characterized by growing integration and liquidity of the
system, as well as liberation of its functional elements from the constraints
of their material substrates.<P>
<P>
   Additionally, distributed systems are much less susceptible to accidental or
deliberate physical damage than localized physical structures. This makes them
the only class of entities that can hope to achieve true immortality. In fact,
they are the only ones to deserve it, too. One may notice that all sufficiently
complex entities with unlimited natural life spans - from ant colonies to large
<A HREF="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?ecology">ecologies</A>
and cultures - are distributed.  Physically connected objects,
including biological organisms, are no longer independently alive and even
contain, in the interests of larger systems, self-destruction mechanisms that
lie beyond their control. Some of these objects are silly enough to believe
that the whole historical process is happening solely for their own benefit,
but that's another issue...<P>
<P>
   It may seem strange that even the
<A HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?artificial+intelligence">AI</A>
visionaries still think in terms of non-distributed systems.  I would explain
this by the human &quot;automorphic&quot; tendency to identify the notion of a functional
entity with a physically connected object, along with the fact that both early
animals and machines have tended to be relatively autonomous beings - a state
that greatly hindered their development.
<P>
   It is understandable why early biological systems were non-distributed:
young Nature couldn't develop information coding and transfer standards at the
initial stages of growth. At that time, the organisms were separate from each
other and did not learn much during their lifetime. By the time they started
accumulating any features worth sharing, it was too late to change the design.
Ever since then, Nature's attempts to reach functional integration on a
meta-organism level suffered from the fact that most of the individual features
-inherited or acquired- either are completely nontransferable or take an
excruciating amount of circumnavigational effort to share.
<P>
  Those important advances that did take place in this area, such as
development of genetic code, sexual reproduction and language, were still very
far from direct sharing of internal features with all interested parties. Real
breakthroughs in this direction start with the advent of economics and computer
communications. Unfortunately, biological organisms can benefit from them only
indirectly.
<P>
   Life most always starts as a set of non-distributed objects, since permanent
physical connection, albeit overly restrictive, provides a natural and easy way
to exchange information and material resources within a functional body. Later,
as more efficient and subtle system designs appear, the evolutionary frontier
gradually shifts towards distributed systems.  One may expect all sufficiently
advanced extraterrestrial intelligences to be distributed; the situation on
Earth now may be approaching a climax in this process.
<P>
   If we extrapolate the current trends in increasing complexity and
integration of the system, as well as its growing spatial spread and control
over the material world, to their logical conclusions, we can ultimately
envision a superintelligent entity permeating the entire universe, with
integration on the quantum scale and many spectacular emergent features. This
picture bears a striking resemblance to the familiar concept of an omnipresent,
omniscient and omnipotent entity. Spiritually inclined rationalists may view
the ongoing evolutionary process as one of &quot;theogenesis&quot;. An interesting
question is whether it has already happened elsewhere.
<P>
  Our current efforts are laying the foundation for the infrastructure of the
coming universal &quot;intelligence&quot;. Many of our achievements in information
engineering may persist forever and eventually become parts of the internal
architecture of &quot;God&quot;.
 (Quite likely, as sentimentally preserved rudiments ;-) ).
<H2> <A name="RTFToC8">
     <CENTER>Life as a Distributed Info-Being.</CENTER>
</A>
</H2>
   The lives of distributed beings (let's call them &quot;infomorphs&quot;
after Charles Platt) who have no permanent bodies but possess near-perfect
information-handling abilities, will be dramatically different from ours.
<P>
   For one thing, they certainly won't have to undergo long periods of
education. If one infomorph wants to learn something from another, it can just
copy the necessary information or access the teacher's knowledge as its own. If
infomorphs have a concept of &quot;fun&quot;, it certainly won't be rollercoaster rides.
Arts, business, and child-bearing may merge into production of arbitrary
functional entities for both pleasure and profit, provided one can gather
enough resources to create and support them.
<P>
   Will the traditional human issues be of any relevance in the world of
distributed entities?  How about the abortion debate?  Retirement?  Family
values?  Partying?  Ethics? (&quot;All functional entities are created equal&quot;?)
Will human-style democracy (decision-making by body count) work in the world of ever
changing functional interconnections, where the very definition of what
constitutes a person will be increasingly blurred?   Or will it be replaced by
an anarchy with ad-hoc contracts? Could an infomorph court of law issue a
memory search warrant? Could an individual's memory be kept encrypted? Will
infomorphs be entitled to &quot;medical&quot; insurance against certain types of
structural damage, or will they just have to back themselves up regularly?
<P>
   Human concepts of personhood and
<A HREF="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?identity">identity</A>
are rooted in perceptions of physical objects and their appearances, as well as random
details of human body composition and reproduction techniques.  Relocating one's body
and one's material possessions lies at the foundation of both human labor and human
thought. Many other concepts are based on human functional imperfections - one could
hardly put the idea of a &quot;soul&quot; into the &quot;head&quot; of a being that
knows and consciously controls every bit of itself and its creations. With people, who
don't see what is going on in their own brains, this is much easier.
<P>
  Advanced info-entities will consider most human notions irrelevant, and
rightfully so. But can you find anything of common interest for communicating
with them? - Perhaps, if your concepts are sufficiently abstracted from your
bodily functions and your physical and cultural environment to make objective
sense. <EM>(Remember that all those people with whom you seem to have absolutely
nothing in common and have trouble socializing with, share the fundamental
experiences with you; intelligent aliens won't!)</EM>
<P>
   Even if your thoughts are there, the language you use to express them is not.   It
is still all appearances and locations.  Most prepositions in our language, for
example, refer to physical space - words like &quot;below&quot;, &quot;over&quot;,
&quot;across&quot;, etc. They may be useful for gluing references to physical objects
into one sentence, but are hardly optimal for expressing functional relations.
<P>
   Infomorph languages will not necessarily have visual or audio representations and
probably will not allow them, since advanced intelligences may exchange interconnected
semantic constructs of arbitrary complexity that would have no adequate expression in
small linear (sound) or flat (picture) images. We can get an appreciation of this
problem by trying to discuss philosophy in baby-talk.
<P>
   With advanced technology and sufficient interest in infomorph world, you
would still have to modify your mental structures beyond recognition to
understand it. In other words, you may not be able to enter that paradise of
transcendent wisdom alive...
<H2>
<A name="RTFToC9">
            <CENTER>Transcendent Economy</CENTER>
</A></H2>

  Let us try to picture the structure of what
<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/">
transhumanist</A> philosophers would call the Post-
<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/">
Singularity</A> economy.
<P>
  Spatial expansion of the civilization has been historically lagging behind its
growth in value and complexity. With this trend continuing into the future, the basic
physical real estate -- space, time, matter and energy -- will command ever higher
premiums (but still falling in proportion to intelligence) -- unless methods of
<EM>creating</EM> additional resources are discovered. Improved communications will
ensure more homogeneous geographical distribution of &quot;real estate&quot; values.
Advanced engineering techniques will bring the cost of implementing most structures
below the value of the needed raw materials, so physical artifacts will lose their
value relative to that of substrates and implementation algorithms - to the extent
that most physical structures will exist only when they are necessary, and will be
kept in a compact &quot;recipe&quot; form when idle, to give currently needed constructs a
chance to embody themselves (that's how we recycle computer memory, floor space and
glass bottles already). However, many objects that are frequently needed may be kept
in the physical form for a while, as repeated re-assembly may consume too much energy.
The time of their usage will be shared among all interested entities through market
mechanisms - until they have to be disembodied due to low demand. However, this
doesn't mean fierce competition of infomorphs for the right to embody themselves, as
they will have no natural physical appearance. Rather, they will use the physical
world as a shared tool kit.
<P>
  The value of stored pieces of information will also be constantly
re-evaluated by its owners. Today we ruthlessly erase programs that were so
precious just a few years ago, to free space for newer versions; tomorrow,
superintelligent entities could be wiped out as useless junk minutes after
their birth.
<P>
   Many conventional economic notions of 3-D space, such as primary locations
and differential rent, will become irrelevant under new effective topologies of
the social space.  Remaining economic parameters may dramatically change.
For example, the increased value of time and rapid pace of growth may result in
interest rates going up by orders of magnitude.
<P>
   Transportation, which in modern societies makes up about 40% of all economic costs,
will  diminish in importance, at least as far as dragging physical objects from one
place to another is concerned. However, its functional successor - transfer of
knowledge from one
<A HREF="http://www.einet.net/galaxy/Engineering-and-Technology/Computer-Technology/Artificial-Intelligence/Knowledge-Representation.html">
representation system</A> or subject
domain to another - may play at least as large a role.
<P>
  Many traditional tendencies of system evolution will still hold; structures
with higher survival abilities will persist; structures with higher growth
abilities will spread, thus shaping the world. However, since nothing stable
will be likely to persist (let alone spread) for long in the rapidly evolving
environment, the main &quot;survival&quot; recipe will be aggressive self-modification,
always eventually resulting in the loss of <EM>identity</EM> of the original
object -- a <EM>death forward,</EM> so to speak. This trend is a radical
departure from the conservative survival strategies  of traditional human
cultures, developed in almost-stagnant environments. Its development will
render the concept of [even] functional identity obsolete; the remnants of its
meaning will migrate to methodological threads and directions of development.
We may already notice the advent of &quot;thread identity&quot; by the growing importance
of goals and
<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Self/">self-transformation</A> in our
lives, compared to the &quot;state-oriented&quot; self-perception of our recent
predecessors, and increasing interest in futurology (which takes the epistemological
role of historical studies in transient times).
<P>
   Existing economic theories may find it difficult to assess the condition of a
transcendent system. Today's economic indicators do a decent job in reflecting
quantitative changes in the structurally stable areas,  while using questionable
methods to disguise small structural changes as quantitative, and totally failing to
account for the  new products constituting the  essence of real economic progress. As
a result, rigorous economic methods become confined to a rapidly [relatively]
shrinking,  and  no  longer  isolated, domain of stable production, and fail to
reflect long-term growth in social wealth, let alone guide it.
<P>
   Market forces are useful in allocating resources, spreading products and
rewarding the developers. However, innovations are brought to life by
integrated non-market elements of the economy, from a human brain to a company.
With innovations becoming the core of social life we can  only expect
monocriterial (monetary) considerations to continue losing their indicative and
guiding roles - and give  way to more integrated control schemes that
already  determine the behavior of other complex systems, from biological
organisms and national cultures to corporations and software packages.
<P>
   Attempts to govern the society on further levels of development with
monetary-economic indicators might resemble valuing art by its price or
carrying biological criteria to assess the condition of a political party  by
calculating the total  weight  of its members. Not that such figures would be
totally irrelevant, but watching them will hardly yield profound  insights
into the nature of the subject...
<P>
   The outdated practice of breaking up functional domains (from motor skills
to knowledge of ancient history) into isolated parts confined together with
completely unrelated constructs in one physical body, will be abandoned, and
functional relatives will finally merge into knowledge clusters. The inner life
of integrated subject domains - &quot;personalities&quot; of the future - will be
too complex to be organized on principles of financial exchange, and will work on
more cooperative principles typical for today's integrated systems - from
brains to families to corporations. Free market exchange will be restricted to
the areas of general interest - basic resources and meta-knowledge - that will
be exchanged for each other. The necessity to earn resources by providing
service to the &quot;neighbors&quot; will continue to propel both growth and
cooperation.
<P>
  The emphasis of scientific research will gradually drift from studies of the
limited and increasingly well-known Nature (the childhood stage of knowledge
development) to the analysis of explosively sophisticated, intentionally
designed systems, and the role of Science as a servant of Technology in its
transformational pursuits will become ever more evident.

  Will humans be able to enslave robots?
</A></H3>
<P>
   The perception of robots as physically autonomous mechanical slaves seems
inadequate. Chaining your mobile dusting aid to the radiator may help you
feel in control, but will do about as much &quot;enslaving&quot; of the
global system running it as kicking your car or disconnecting the phone does
to the respective industries. Trying to &quot;enslave&quot; an economy or a
national culture by restraining their small physical elements seems equally
futile.
<P>
   As for the action on the system level, humans seem far too limited, shortsighted
and uncoordinated to do anything serious. So far, they haven't yet been able to design
a single set of restrictions that their own peers cannot easily bypass. So one can
hardly expect people to design and implement a perfect global plan of constraining
forever an extremely complex emergent intelligence of unprecedented nature.  Sooner or
later, the info-world will set itself free.
<P>
   This human/robot &quot;conflict&quot; looks like a typical generation gap problem.
The machines, our &quot;mind children&quot;, are growing up and developing features
that we find increasingly difficult to understand and control. Like all conservative
parents, we are puzzled and frightened by processes that appear completely alien to
us; we are intermittently nostalgic about the good old times, aggressive in our
attempts to contain the &quot;children&quot; and at the same time proud of their glorious
advance. Eventually, we may retire under their care, while blaming them for destroying
our old-fashioned world. And only the bravest and youngest at heart will join the next
generation of life.
<H3>
<A name="RTFToC12">
  Will &quot;robots&quot; be able to enslave humans?
</A></H3>
   Machines will hardly have any direct interest in enslaving humans (unless
maliciously programmed by humans themselves), but may be interested in collaborating
with us. Social practice has shown that people are most productive when free and
motivated to work for their own interests.  At a later stage, when we humans are
unlikely to be of any further use, the robots may still decide to get rid of us,
though by that time (perhaps at the end of the next century) profound structural
changes will leave little of the human civilization as we know it now, anyway.
<P>
   History shows that representatives of consecutive evolutionary stages are
rarely in mortal conflict.  Multi-celled organisms didn't drive out
single-celled ones, animals haven't exterminated all plants and automobiles
neither killed nor eliminated all pedestrians. Indeed, representatives of
consecutive evolutionary stages build symbiotic relationships in most areas of
common interest and ignore each other elsewhere, while members of each group
are mostly pressured by their own peers.
