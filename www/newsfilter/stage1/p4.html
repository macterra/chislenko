    <td width="100%" colspan="2">The idea of MRF is that every message can have different
    rating in different fields of interests. This rating is called a <i>named rating</i>. <p>MRF
    presents a user the same catalog as <a href="p2.html">MSF</a>, but this catalog will be
    opened at the place in the catalog tree where the current named rating/field of interest
    is located. So, by default user will be asked to rate the current message for the current
    field of interest. But still he/she has a possibility of selecting another filed of
    interest. After selecting an appropriate field of interest a user will be able to rate the
    message by an integer value from 1 to 10.</td>

    different fields of interests. ARF presents a user a list of advisors who have rated the
    current message. User will be able to set rating to any number of advisors presented in
    this list.</td>
