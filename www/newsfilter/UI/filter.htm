<p align="left">This form lets the user enter advanced settings.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">By default, all the messages under the selected interests &amp;
recommended by the favorite advisors will be shown to the user.&nbsp; This means that by
default only the &quot;filter advisors-&gt;favorite advisors&quot; only&nbsp; check-box is
selected.</p>

<p align="left">However, there is a possibility for the user to change the selection of
messages.</p>

<p align="left">1.&nbsp; The user can request the messages recommended by the advisors
selected in the Settings form only with a specific rating-- from 1 to 10.(filter
advisors-&gt; by rating)&nbsp; If this check box is selected together with &quot;filter
advisors-&gt;favorite advisors only&quot;, only the messages recommended by the favorite
advisors rated within the set limitations will be shown.&nbsp; Otherwise, the information
about the favorite advisors in the settings form will be skipped.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; The user can request the messages rated by different advisors with a specific
message grade--from 1 to 10 (filter messages-&gt;by rating)</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; The user can request the messages written within a specific time period
(filter messages-&gt;by date)</p>

<p>Just like in #1, this selection(##2,3) can be inquired from the favorite advisors list
from the Settings form or not by selecting or deselecting &quot;filter
messages-&gt;favorite advisors only&quot;</p>
