<p>This is the settings form which allows users to edit/choose their favorite advisors.</p>

<p>In the left form part the list of advisors for the active interest is represented.
&nbsp; (An interest is considered to be active when chosen in the Settings form) &nbsp;
The user can select some/all of them by pressing buttons &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; &amp;
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;.&nbsp; Button &quot;People respected by advisors&quot; returns the
list of advisors prefered to the advisors chosen in the list.&nbsp; Button &quot;Find
like-minded people&quot; returns the list of advisors with settings closest to the user's
settings.</p>

<p>If check box &quot;Use automatic selection&quot; is active, the user instead of &nbsp;
selecting advisors from the list, gets a standart list of either the most rated advisors
or the most popular advisors, depending on which one of the two radio-buttons is on.</p>

<p>Button &quot;Ok&quot; returns the user back to the &quot;Settings&quot; form, having
admitted the setting change;&nbsp; button &quot;Cancel&quot; does the same, but without a
advisor setting change.</p>
