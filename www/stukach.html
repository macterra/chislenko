<DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<STRONG>Stukach</STRONG> [pronounced stoo'katch] is the Russian word for a government
informant, whose job was to report on his or her fellow citisens, neighbors,
colleagues, friends, and family members.  The victims would then be watched,
interrogated, killed, tortured, or just scared to death denied much of the
scarce rights they had, depending on the current whim of the government
officials.
<P>
This stukach figure is of course not specific to the Soviet empire; however,
as probably the most spectacular implementation of totalitarianism in
human history, the Soviet "communist" state, it "enriched" the human
vocabulary with this horrible word, and demonstrated that existence of
millions of people ready to betray their friends for the scraps from the
rulers' table is vital to the survival of the repressive state - just as
is the sheepeshness of the rest of the population.
<P>
There was no case in history when the informants were
brought to justice.  Quite the opposite: they, as their former rulers,
usually have more power, money, and health than their victims and, when
the political climate changes, they and their children still occupy the
best positions in the society and control its policies and resources.
Meanwhile, their victims, if they are alive, stunned with the horrible
injustice, have to either work for their former torturers, or flee to
other countries.  Unfortunately, the populations of other countries
seem always composed mostly of the same sheepish kind of people,
more concerned about their selfish primitive pursuits than any
considerations of universal justice.  I have never heard of a case where
a KGB victim or a person who refused Vietnam draft would be given better
health care or salary than their persecutors.  (And guess who had better
chances to maintain their health and job skills).
<P>
These things happen in almost every country in the world.
People who are persecuted by the government for attempts to exercise
their personal freedoms and better judgement for exploration or improvement
of the world (including reading or saying "wrong" things, crossing the
government-drawn lines, or trying "wrong" behaviors or substances) are
rarely reimbursed, or even apologized to, even when the government finally
declares their behavior "permissible".  And of course, people who passed
and executed the rules, as well as those who provided them with funds and
victims, never get punished.
<P>
I am not naive enough to hope to restore justice.
However, I want to make at least the smallest contribution I can:
make the names of the villains known.

<P>
Here is my personal stukach list - these are my former classmates
who reported on me after I shared my opinions on the virtues of the
Soviet regime with a number of fellow students (all of them, as
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/home.html">myself</A>,
graduated from the mathematical department of the Leningrad State
University in 1982).  I personally saw their names signed on the
papers shown to me by the KGB agents interrogating me in 1981.
I hope they and their friends will find their names here.
And so will their prospective employers.
<UL>
<LI>Vladimir Azhotkin
<LI>Stanislaw Lebedev
<LI>Sergey Shushkov
<LI>Gennady Mishuris
</UL>
These people wrecked more of my life, nerves, and trust in the world than
I could ever hope to recover.
Still, I may consider taking their names off this list after they manage to
repay their debts in repentance, support, and public service to me
personally and everybody else who suffered from them and other informants.
<P>
Do you have your own stukach list?  Post it anywhere on the Web, and link
to this page.  I will provide a function here that will display all linked
pages.

<H3>Significant events in the history of this page</H3>

The page was created born Dec 9, 1997
<P>
On December 10, 1997  I received the first batch of comments, mostly
from Russian people.  They generally agreed with the points stated here,
except for two points; they follow here, with my answers:
(they are hasty and personal; I'll polish them later, as the rest of this page.
Can't work on this stuff for too long: get too emotional, and besides there are
other things to do)
<P>
<EM>
Wouldn't it be scary if someone will put a name of his/her enemy
an a list as stukach.  There is no way for those people to prove
their innocence.

- Yes. lies are a problem on the Net, and will remain so until someone implements
a reputation brokering server.  I know exactly how to do it, and have been trying
to convince humans to take it on - but they are more interested in fun than in truth,
so millions of dollars get invested into assured delivery of silly pictures, and none -
into assurance of truth.  It's their problem.  But one of the ways to make stupid
people implement useful things, is to launch services that they can understand that
will make the necessity of reputation server obvious.  This is one of such services.
<P>
<EM>
Lets just forgive them, get them out of our mind and go on with our lives.

- Do you easily forgive your personal enemies?
Informants and KGB agents are my personal enemies - I spent most of my conscious
life figuring out how to get rid of them, trying to explain it to others, reading about
other wonderful and brilliant people who perished because of these scums, and fearing
them ALL THE TIME.  Most of my former compatriots went about their little businesses
and let somebody else preserve the ideas and the spirit of freedom.  People who fought
and feared, are those who won the struggle and brought the most dangerous bunch of
political regimes in human history to collapse.  The ungrateful masses never rewarded
them, but even if they did, they would not have the right to forgive their enemies for them.
<BR>
If we forgive those who sent millions of the most intelligent, creative, and brave people to
torture and death, and robbed the rest of the humanity forever from the benefit of their work,
shouldn't we just let all other small-scale criminals, like murderers, rapists, and burglars,
go home with a smile? 
<BR>
You would never do it with people who badly hurt your family.  I would never forgive those
who hurt mine.   It's that my family is just a bit bigger.

<H4>The latest development...</H4>
On December 11, I contacted Gennady Mishuris, one of the above
"magnificent four", and told him about this page.  Would be interesting to
see what he says.  Stay tuned...
